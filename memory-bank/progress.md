# Progress: Self-hosted AI Package

## What Works

*   The core Docker Compose setup is defined, orchestrating multiple services.
*   The `start_services.py` script handles the two-stage startup and profile selection for Ollama.
*   Environment variable management via the `.env` file is implemented.
*   SearXNG's initial setup is automated by the startup script.
*   The README provides comprehensive instructions for installation, setup, usage, upgrading, and troubleshooting.
*   The `project_summary.md` provides a good overview of the startup process and Docker Compose structure.
*   The core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created and populated based on existing documentation.

## What's Left to Build

*   Further detailed documentation within the memory bank for specific components (e.g., detailed Supabase schema, n8n workflow explanations beyond the README summary, Flowise flow structures, Caddy configuration details, Langfuse integration specifics).
*   Potentially more advanced examples or integrations.
*   Refinement of cloud deployment instructions.
*   Comprehensive testing suite for the setup script and service interactions.

## Current Status

The initial memory bank initialization is complete, providing a foundational understanding of the project's purpose, technical stack, system architecture, and current state based on the provided documentation.

## Known Issues

*   Supabase Pooler Restarting (documented in README troubleshooting).
*   Supabase Analytics Startup Failure after password change (documented in README troubleshooting).
*   Docker Desktop "Expose daemon" setting requirement (documented in README troubleshooting).
*   Supabase Service Unavailable due to "@" in Postgres password (documented in README troubleshooting).
*   Windows/Linux GPU support issues (documented in README troubleshooting).

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Decision to use Docker Compose for orchestration.
*   Decision to use a Python script for orchestrated startup and specific service initialization (like SearXNG).
*   Decision to support multiple Ollama configurations via Docker Compose profiles.
*   Decision to include a wide range of tools (Ollama, Open WebUI, Supabase, n8n, Flowise, Qdrant, SearXNG, Caddy, Langfuse) to provide a comprehensive local AI development environment.
