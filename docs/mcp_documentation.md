# Introduction

> Get started with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

<Note>C# SDK released! Check out [what else is new.](/development/updates)</Note>

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

## Why MCP?

MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides:

* A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
* The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
* Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure

### General architecture

At its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Your Computer"
        Host["Host with MCP Client\n(Claude, IDEs, Tools)"]
        S1["MCP Server A"]
        S2["MCP Server B"]
        S3["MCP Server C"]
        Host <-->|"MCP Protocol"| S1
        Host <-->|"MCP Protocol"| S2
        Host <-->|"MCP Protocol"| S3
        S1 <--> D1[("Local\nData Source A")]
        S2 <--> D2[("Local\nData Source B")]
    end
    subgraph "Internet"
        S3 <-->|"Web APIs"| D3[("Remote\nService C")]
    end
```

* **MCP Hosts**: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP
* **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers
* **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
* **Local Data Sources**: Your computer's files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access
* **Remote Services**: External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to

# For Server Developers

> Get started building your own server to use in Claude for Desktop and other clients.

In this tutorial, we'll build a simple MCP weather server and connect it to a host, Claude for Desktop. We'll start with a basic setup, and then progress to more complex use cases.

### What we'll be building

Many LLMs do not currently have the ability to fetch the forecast and severe weather alerts. Let's use MCP to solve that!

We'll build a server that exposes two tools: `get-alerts` and `get-forecast`. Then we'll connect the server to an MCP host (in this case, Claude for Desktop):

</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/current-weather.png" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Servers can connect to any client. We've chosen Claude for Desktop here for simplicity, but we also have guides on [building your own client](/quickstart/client) as well as a [list of other clients here](/clients).
</Note>

<Accordion title="Why Claude for Desktop and not Claude.ai?">
  Because servers are locally run, MCP currently only supports desktop hosts. Remote hosts are in active development.
</Accordion>

### Core MCP Concepts

MCP servers can provide three main types of capabilities:

1. **Resources**: File-like data that can be read by clients (like API responses or file contents)
2. **Tools**: Functions that can be called by the LLM (with user approval)
3. **Prompts**: Pre-written templates that help users accomplish specific tasks

This tutorial will primarily focus on tools.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    Let's get started with building our weather server! [You can find the complete code for what we'll be building here.](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/quickstart-resources/tree/main/weather-server-python)

    ### Prerequisite knowledge

    This quickstart assumes you have familiarity with:

    * Python
    * LLMs like Claude

    ### System requirements

    * Python 3.10 or higher installed.
    * You must use the Python MCP SDK 1.2.0 or higher.

    ### Set up your environment

    First, let's install `uv` and set up our Python project and environment:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash MacOS/Linux
      curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
      ```

      ```powershell Windows
      powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Make sure to restart your terminal afterwards to ensure that the `uv` command gets picked up.

    Now, let's create and set up our project:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash MacOS/Linux
      # Create a new directory for our project
      uv init weather
      cd weather

      # Create virtual environment and activate it
      uv venv
      source .venv/bin/activate

      # Install dependencies
      uv add "mcp[cli]" httpx

      # Create our server file
      touch weather.py
      ```

      ```powershell Windows
      # Create a new directory for our project
      uv init weather
      cd weather

      # Create virtual environment and activate it
      uv venv
      .venv\Scripts\activate

      # Install dependencies
      uv add mcp[cli] httpx

      # Create our server file
      new-item weather.py
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Now let's dive into building your server.

    ## Building your server

    ### Importing packages and setting up the instance

    Add these to the top of your `weather.py`:

    ```python
    from typing import Any
    import httpx
    from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

    # Initialize FastMCP server
    mcp = FastMCP("weather")

    # Constants
    NWS_API_BASE = "https://api.weather.gov"
    USER_AGENT = "weather-app/1.0"
    ```

    The FastMCP class uses Python type hints and docstrings to automatically generate tool definitions, making it easy to create and maintain MCP tools.

    ### Helper functions

    Next, let's add our helper functions for querying and formatting the data from the National Weather Service API:

    ```python
    async def make_nws_request(url: str) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
        """Make a request to the NWS API with proper error handling."""
        headers = {
            "User-Agent": USER_AGENT,
            "Accept": "application/geo+json"
        }
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            try:
                response = await client.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=30.0)
                response.raise_for_status()
                return response.json()
            except Exception:
                return None

    def format_alert(feature: dict) -> str:
        """Format an alert feature into a readable string."""
        props = feature["properties"]
        return f"""
    Event: {props.get('event', 'Unknown')}
    Area: {props.get('areaDesc', 'Unknown')}
    Severity: {props.get('severity', 'Unknown')}
    Description: {props.get('description', 'No description available')}
    Instructions: {props.get('instruction', 'No specific instructions provided')}
    """
    ```

    ### Implementing tool execution

    The tool execution handler is responsible for actually executing the logic of each tool. Let's add it:

    ```python
    @mcp.tool()
    async def get_alerts(state: str) -> str:
        """Get weather alerts for a US state.

        Args:
            state: Two-letter US state code (e.g. CA, NY)
        """
        url = f"{NWS_API_BASE}/alerts/active/area/{state}"
        data = await make_nws_request(url)

        if not data or "features" not in data:
            return "Unable to fetch alerts or no alerts found."

        if not data["features"]:
            return "No active alerts for this state."

        alerts = [format_alert(feature) for feature in data["features"]]
        return "\n---\n".join(alerts)

    @mcp.tool()
    async def get_forecast(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> str:
        """Get weather forecast for a location.

        Args:
            latitude: Latitude of the location
            longitude: Longitude of the location
        """
        # First get the forecast grid endpoint
        points_url = f"{NWS_API_BASE}/points/{latitude},{longitude}"
        points_data = await make_nws_request(points_url)

        if not points_data:
            return "Unable to fetch forecast data for this location."

        # Get the forecast URL from the points response
        forecast_url = points_data["properties"]["forecast"]
        forecast_data = await make_nws_request(forecast_url)

        if not forecast_data:
            return "Unable to fetch detailed forecast."

        # Format the periods into a readable forecast
        periods = forecast_data["properties"]["periods"]
        forecasts = []
        for period in periods[:5]:  # Only show next 5 periods
            forecast = f"""
    {period['name']}:
    Temperature: {period['temperature']}°{period['temperatureUnit']}
    Wind: {period['windSpeed']} {period['windDirection']}
    Forecast: {period['detailedForecast']}
    """
            forecasts.append(forecast)

        return "\n---\n".join(forecasts)
    ```

    ### Running the server

    Finally, let's initialize and run the server:

    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # Initialize and run the server
        mcp.run(transport='stdio')
    ```

    Your server is complete! Run `uv run weather.py` to confirm that everything's working.

    Let's now test your server from an existing MCP host, Claude for Desktop.

    ## Testing your server with Claude for Desktop

    <Note>
      Claude for Desktop is not yet available on Linux. Linux users can proceed to the [Building a client](/quickstart/client) tutorial to build an MCP client that connects to the server we just built.
    </Note>

    First, make sure you have Claude for Desktop installed. [You can install the latest version
    here.](https://claude.ai/download) If you already have Claude for Desktop, **make sure it's updated to the latest version.**

    We'll need to configure Claude for Desktop for whichever MCP servers you want to use. To do this, open your Claude for Desktop App configuration at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor. Make sure to create the file if it doesn't exist.

    For example, if you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="MacOS/Linux">
        ```bash
        code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Windows">
        ```powershell
        code $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    You'll then add your servers in the `mcpServers` key. The MCP UI elements will only show up in Claude for Desktop if at least one server is properly configured.

    In this case, we'll add our single weather server like so:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="MacOS/Linux">
        ```json Python
        {
            "mcpServers": {
                "weather": {
                    "command": "uv",
                    "args": [
                        "--directory",
                        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather",
                        "run",
                        "weather.py"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Windows">
        ```json Python
        {
            "mcpServers": {
                "weather": {
                    "command": "uv",
                    "args": [
                        "--directory",
                        "C:\\ABSOLUTE\\PATH\\TO\\PARENT\\FOLDER\\weather",
                        "run",
                        "weather.py"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    <Warning>
      You may need to put the full path to the `uv` executable in the `command` field. You can get this by running `which uv` on MacOS/Linux or `where uv` on Windows.
    </Warning>

    <Note>
      Make sure you pass in the absolute path to your server.
    </Note>

    This tells Claude for Desktop:

    1. There's an MCP server named "weather"
    2. To launch it by running `uv --directory /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather run weather.py`

    Save the file, and restart **Claude for Desktop**.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Node">
    Let's get started with building our weather server! [You can find the complete code for what we'll be building here.](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/quickstart-resources/tree/main/weather-server-typescript)

    ### Prerequisite knowledge

    This quickstart assumes you have familiarity with:

    * TypeScript
    * LLMs like Claude

    ### System requirements

    For TypeScript, make sure you have the latest version of Node installed.

    ### Set up your environment

    First, let's install Node.js and npm if you haven't already. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
    Verify your Node.js installation:

    ```bash
    node --version
    npm --version
    ```

    For this tutorial, you'll need Node.js version 16 or higher.

    Now, let's create and set up our project:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash MacOS/Linux
      # Create a new directory for our project
      mkdir weather
      cd weather

      # Initialize a new npm project
      npm init -y

      # Install dependencies
      npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk zod
      npm install -D @types/node typescript

      # Create our files
      mkdir src
      touch src/index.ts
      ```

      ```powershell Windows
      # Create a new directory for our project
      md weather
      cd weather

      # Initialize a new npm project
      npm init -y

      # Install dependencies
      npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk zod
      npm install -D @types/node typescript

      # Create our files
      md src
      new-item src\index.ts
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Update your package.json to add type: "module" and a build script:

    ```json package.json
    {
      "type": "module",
      "bin": {
        "weather": "./build/index.js"
      },
      "scripts": {
        "build": "tsc && chmod 755 build/index.js"
      },
      "files": [
        "build"
      ],
    }
    ```

    Create a `tsconfig.json` in the root of your project:

    ```json tsconfig.json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "ES2022",
        "module": "Node16",
        "moduleResolution": "Node16",
        "outDir": "./build",
        "rootDir": "./src",
        "strict": true,
        "esModuleInterop": true,
        "skipLibCheck": true,
        "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
      },
      "include": ["src/**/*"],
      "exclude": ["node_modules"]
    }
    ```

    Now let's dive into building your server.

    ## Building your server

    ### Importing packages and setting up the instance

    Add these to the top of your `src/index.ts`:

    ```typescript
    import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
    import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
    import { z } from "zod";

    const NWS_API_BASE = "https://api.weather.gov";
    const USER_AGENT = "weather-app/1.0";

    // Create server instance
    const server = new McpServer({
      name: "weather",
      version: "1.0.0",
      capabilities: {
        resources: {},
        tools: {},
      },
    });
    ```

    ### Helper functions

    Next, let's add our helper functions for querying and formatting the data from the National Weather Service API:

    ```typescript
    // Helper function for making NWS API requests
    async function makeNWSRequest<T>(url: string): Promise<T | null> {
      const headers = {
        "User-Agent": USER_AGENT,
        Accept: "application/geo+json",
      };

      try {
        const response = await fetch(url, { headers });
        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
        }
        return (await response.json()) as T;
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error making NWS request:", error);
        return null;
      }
    }

    interface AlertFeature {
      properties: {
        event?: string;
        areaDesc?: string;
        severity?: string;
        status?: string;
        headline?: string;
      };
    }

    // Format alert data
    function formatAlert(feature: AlertFeature): string {
      const props = feature.properties;
      return [
        `Event: ${props.event || "Unknown"}`,
        `Area: ${props.areaDesc || "Unknown"}`,
        `Severity: ${props.severity || "Unknown"}`,
        `Status: ${props.status || "Unknown"}`,
        `Headline: ${props.headline || "No headline"}`,
        "---",
      ].join("\n");
    }

    interface ForecastPeriod {
      name?: string;
      temperature?: number;
      temperatureUnit?: string;
      windSpeed?: string;
      windDirection?: string;
      shortForecast?: string;
    }

    interface AlertsResponse {
      features: AlertFeature[];
    }

    interface PointsResponse {
      properties: {
        forecast?: string;
      };
    }

    interface ForecastResponse {
      properties: {
        periods: ForecastPeriod[];
      };
    }
    ```

    ### Implementing tool execution

    The tool execution handler is responsible for actually executing the logic of each tool. Let's add it:

    ```typescript
    // Register weather tools
    server.tool(
      "get-alerts",
      "Get weather alerts for a state",
      {
        state: z.string().length(2).describe("Two-letter state code (e.g. CA, NY)"),
      },
      async ({ state }) => {
        const stateCode = state.toUpperCase();
        const alertsUrl = `${NWS_API_BASE}/alerts?area=${stateCode}`;
        const alertsData = await makeNWSRequest<AlertsResponse>(alertsUrl);

        if (!alertsData) {
          return {
            content: [
              {
                type: "text",
                text: "Failed to retrieve alerts data",
              },
            ],
          };
        }

        const features = alertsData.features || [];
        if (features.length === 0) {
          return {
            content: [
              {
                type: "text",
                text: `No active alerts for ${stateCode}`,
              },
            ],
          };
        }

        const formattedAlerts = features.map(formatAlert);
        const alertsText = `Active alerts for ${stateCode}:\n\n${formattedAlerts.join("\n")}`;

        return {
          content: [
            {
              type: "text",
              text: alertsText,
            },
          ],
        };
      },
    );

    server.tool(
      "get-forecast",
      "Get weather forecast for a location",
      {
        latitude: z.number().min(-90).max(90).describe("Latitude of the location"),
        longitude: z.number().min(-180).max(180).describe("Longitude of the location"),
      },
      async ({ latitude, longitude }) => {
        // Get grid point data
        const pointsUrl = `${NWS_API_BASE}/points/${latitude.toFixed(4)},${longitude.toFixed(4)}`;
        const pointsData = await makeNWSRequest<PointsResponse>(pointsUrl);

        if (!pointsData) {
          return {
            content: [
              {
                type: "text",
                text: `Failed to retrieve grid point data for coordinates: ${latitude}, ${longitude}. This location may not be supported by the NWS API (only US locations are supported).`,
              },
            ],
          };
        }

        const forecastUrl = pointsData.properties?.forecast;
        if (!forecastUrl) {
          return {
            content: [
              {
                type: "text",
                text: "Failed to get forecast URL from grid point data",
              },
            ],
          };
        }

        // Get forecast data
        const forecastData = await makeNWSRequest<ForecastResponse>(forecastUrl);
        if (!forecastData) {
          return {
            content: [
              {
                type: "text",
                text: "Failed to retrieve forecast data",
              },
            ],
          };
        }

        const periods = forecastData.properties?.periods || [];
        if (periods.length === 0) {
          return {
            content: [
              {
                type: "text",
                text: "No forecast periods available",
              },
            ],
          };
        }

        // Format forecast periods

              text: forecastText,
            },
          ],
        };
      },
    );
    ```

    ### Running the server

    Finally, implement the main function to run the server:

    ```typescript
    async function main() {
      const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
      await server.connect(transport);
      console.error("Weather MCP Server running on stdio");
    }

    main().catch((error) => {
      console.error("Fatal error in main():", error);
      process.exit(1);
    });
    ```

    Make sure to run `npm run build` to build your server! This is a very important step in getting your server to connect.

    Let's now test your server from an existing MCP host, Claude for Desktop.

    ## Testing your server with Claude for Desktop

    <Note>
      Claude for Desktop is not yet available on Linux. Linux users can proceed to the [Building a client](/quickstart/client) tutorial to build an MCP client that connects to the server we just built.
    </Note>

    First, make sure you have Claude for Desktop installed. [You can install the latest version
    here.](https://claude.ai/download) If you already have Claude for Desktop, **make sure it's updated to the latest version.**

    We'll need to configure Claude for Desktop for whichever MCP servers you want to use. To do this, open your Claude for Desktop App configuration at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor. Make sure to create the file if it doesn't exist.

    For example, if you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="MacOS/Linux">
        ```bash
        code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Windows">
        ```powershell
        code $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    You'll then add your servers in the `mcpServers` key. The MCP UI elements will only show up in Claude for Desktop if at least one server is properly configured.

    In this case, we'll add our single weather server like so:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="MacOS/Linux">
        <CodeGroup>
          ```json Node
          {
              "mcpServers": {
                  "weather": {
                      "command": "node",
                      "args": [
                          "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather/build/index.js"
                      ]
                  }
              }
          }
          ```
        </CodeGroup>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Windows">
        <CodeGroup>
          ```json Node
          {
              "mcpServers": {
                  "weather": {
                      "command": "node",
                      "args": [
                          "C:\\PATH\\TO\\PARENT\\FOLDER\\weather\\build\\index.js"
                      ]
                  }
              }
          }
          ```
        </CodeGroup>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    This tells Claude for Desktop:

    1. There's an MCP server named "weather"
    2. Launch it by running `node /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather/build/index.js`

    Save the file, and restart **Claude for Desktop**.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Java">
    <Note>
      This is a quickstart demo based on Spring AI MCP auto-configuration and boot starters.
      To learn how to create sync and async MCP Servers, manually, consult the [Java SDK Server](/sdk/java/mcp-server) documentation.
    </Note>

    Let's get started with building our weather server!
    [You can find the complete code for what we'll be building here.](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/tree/main/model-context-protocol/weather/starter-stdio-server)

    For more information, see the [MCP Server Boot Starter](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/mcp/mcp-server-boot-starter-docs.html) reference documentation.
    For manual MCP Server implementation, refer to the [MCP Server Java SDK documentation](/sdk/java/mcp-server).

    ### System requirements

    * Java 17 or higher installed.
    * [Spring Boot 3.3.x](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/installing.html) or higher

    ### Set up your environment

    Use the [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io/) to bootstrap the project.

    You will need to add the following dependencies:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Maven">
        ```xml
        <dependencies>
              <dependency>
                  <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
                  <artifactId>spring-ai-starter-mcp-server</artifactId>
              </dependency>

              <dependency>
                  <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
                  <artifactId>spring-web</artifactId>
              </dependency>
        </dependencies>
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Gradle">
        ```groovy
        dependencies {
          implementation platform("org.springframework.ai:spring-ai-starter-mcp-server")
          implementation platform("org.springframework:spring-web")   
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Then configure your application by setting the application properties:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash application.properties
      spring.main.bannerMode=off
      logging.pattern.console=
      ```

      ```yaml application.yml
      logging:
        pattern:
          console:
      spring:
        main:
          banner-mode: off
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    The [Server Configuration Properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/mcp/mcp-server-boot-starter-docs.html#_configuration_properties) documents all available properties.

    Now let's dive into building your server.

    ## Building your server

    ### Weather Service

    Let's implement a [WeatherService.java](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/blob/main/model-context-protocol/weather/starter-stdio-server/src/main/java/org/springframework/ai/mcp/sample/server/WeatherService.java) that uses a REST client to query the data from the National Weather Service API:

    ```java
    @Service
    public class WeatherService {

    	private final RestClient restClient;

    	public WeatherService() {
    		this.restClient = RestClient.builder()
    			.baseUrl("https://api.weather.gov")
    			.defaultHeader("Accept", "application/geo+json")
    			.defaultHeader("User-Agent", "WeatherApiClient/1.0 (your@email.com)")
    			.build();
    	}

      @Tool(description = "Get weather forecast for a specific latitude/longitude")
      public String getWeatherForecastByLocation(
          double latitude,   // Latitude coordinate
          double longitude   // Longitude coordinate
      ) {
          // Returns detailed forecast including:
          // - Temperature and unit
          // - Wind speed and direction
          // - Detailed forecast description
      }
    	
      @Tool(description = "Get weather alerts for a US state")
      public String getAlerts(
          @ToolParam(description = "Two-letter US state code (e.g. CA, NY)" String state
      ) {
          // Returns active alerts including:
          // - Event type
          // - Affected area
          // - Severity
          // - Description
          // - Safety instructions
      }

      // ......
    }
    ```

    The `@Service` annotation with auto-register the service in your application context.
    The Spring AI `@Tool` annotation, making it easy to create and maintain MCP tools.

    The auto-configuration will automatically register these tools with the MCP server.

    ### Create your Boot Application

    ```java
    @SpringBootApplication
    public class McpServerApplication {

    	public static void main(String[] args) {
    		SpringApplication.run(McpServerApplication.class, args);
    	}

    	@Bean
    	public ToolCallbackProvider weatherTools(WeatherService weatherService) {
    		return  MethodToolCallbackProvider.builder().toolObjects(weatherService).build();
    	}
    }
    ```

    Uses the the `MethodToolCallbackProvider` utils to convert the `@Tools` into actionable callbacks used by the MCP server.

    ### Running the server

    Finally, let's build the server:

    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    ```

    This will generate a `mcp-weather-stdio-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` file within the `target` folder.

    Let's now test your server from an existing MCP host, Claude for Desktop.

    ## Testing your server with Claude for Desktop

    <Note>
      Claude for Desktop is not yet available on Linux.
    </Note>

    First, make sure you have Claude for Desktop installed.
    [You can install the latest version here.](https://claude.ai/download) If you already have Claude for Desktop, **make sure it's updated to the latest version.**

    We'll need to configure Claude for Desktop for whichever MCP servers you want to use.
    To do this, open your Claude for Desktop App configuration at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor.
    Make sure to create the file if it doesn't exist.

    For example, if you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="MacOS/Linux">
        ```bash
        code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Windows">
        ```powershell
        code $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    You'll then add your servers in the `mcpServers` key.
    The MCP UI elements will only show up in Claude for Desktop if at least one server is properly configured.

    In this case, we'll add our single weather server like so:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="MacOS/Linux">
        ```json java
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "spring-ai-mcp-weather": {
              "command": "java",
              "args": [
                "-Dspring.ai.mcp.server.stdio=true",
                "-jar",
                "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/mcp-weather-stdio-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"
              ]
            }
          }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Windows">
        ```json java
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "spring-ai-mcp-weather": {
              "command": "java",
              "args": [
                "-Dspring.ai.mcp.server.transport=STDIO",
                "-jar",
                "C:\\ABSOLUTE\\PATH\\TO\\PARENT\\FOLDER\\weather\\mcp-weather-stdio-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"
              ]
            }
          }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    <Note>
      Make sure you pass in the absolute path to your server.
    </Note>

    This tells Claude for Desktop:

    1. There's an MCP server named "my-weather-server"
    2. To launch it by running `java -jar /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/mcp-weather-stdio-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

    Save the file, and restart **Claude for Desktop**.

    ## Testing your server with Java client

    ### Create a MCP Client manually

    Use the `McpClient` to connect to the server:

    ```java
    var stdioParams = ServerParameters.builder("java")
      .args("-jar", "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/mcp-weather-stdio-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar")
      .build();

    var stdioTransport = new StdioClientTransport(stdioParams);

    var mcpClient = McpClient.sync(stdioTransport).build();

    mcpClient.initialize();

    ListToolsResult toolsList = mcpClient.listTools();

    CallToolResult weather = mcpClient.callTool(
      new CallToolRequest("getWeatherForecastByLocation",
          Map.of("latitude", "47.6062", "longitude", "-122.3321")));

    CallToolResult alert = mcpClient.callTool(
      new CallToolRequest("getAlerts", Map.of("state", "NY")));

    mcpClient.closeGracefully();
    ```

    ### Use MCP Client Boot Starter

    Create a new boot starter application using the `spring-ai-starter-mcp-client` dependency:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-ai-starter-mcp-client</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```

    and set the `spring.ai.mcp.client.stdio.servers-configuration` property to point to your `claude_desktop_config.json`.
    You can re-use the existing Anthropic Desktop configuration:

    ```properties
    spring.ai.mcp.client.stdio.servers-configuration=file:PATH/TO/claude_desktop_config.json
    ```

    When you start your client application, the auto-configuration will create, automatically MCP clients from the claude\_desktop\_config.json.

    For more information, see the [MCP Client Boot Starters](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/mcp/mcp-server-boot-client-docs.html) reference documentation.

  <Tab title="Kotlin">
    Let's get started with building our weather server! [You can find the complete code for what we'll be building here.](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/kotlin-sdk/tree/main/samples/weather-stdio-server)

    ### Prerequisite knowledge

    This quickstart assumes you have familiarity with:

    * Kotlin
    * LLMs like Claude

    ### System requirements

    * Java 17 or higher installed.

    ### Set up your environment

    First, let's install `java` and `gradle` if you haven't already.
    You can download `java` from [official Oracle JDK website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
    Verify your `java` installation:

    ```bash
    java --version
    ```

    Now, let's create and set up your project:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash MacOS/Linux
      # Create a new directory for our project
      mkdir weather
      cd weather

      # Initialize a new kotlin project
      gradle init
      ```

      ```powershell Windows
      # Create a new directory for our project
      md weather
      cd weather

      # Initialize a new kotlin project
      gradle init
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    After running `gradle init`, you will be presented with options for creating your project.
    Select **Application** as the project type, **Kotlin** as the programming language, and **Java 17** as the Java version.

    Alternatively, you can create a Kotlin application using the [IntelliJ IDEA project wizard](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/jvm-get-started.html).

    After creating the project, add the following dependencies:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```kotlin build.gradle.kts
      val mcpVersion = "0.4.0"
      val slf4jVersion = "2.0.9"
      val ktorVersion = "3.1.1"

      dependencies {
          implementation("io.modelcontextprotocol:kotlin-sdk:$mcpVersion")
          implementation("org.slf4j:slf4j-nop:$slf4jVersion")
          implementation("io.ktor:ktor-client-content-negotiation:$ktorVersion")
          implementation("io.ktor:ktor-serialization-kotlinx-json:$ktorVersion")
      }
      ```

      ```groovy build.gradle
      def mcpVersion = '0.3.0'
      def slf4jVersion = '2.0.9'
      def ktorVersion = '3.1.1'

      dependencies {
          implementation "io.modelcontextprotocol:kotlin-sdk:$mcpVersion"
          implementation "org.slf4j:slf4j-nop:$slf4jVersion"
          implementation "io.ktor:ktor-client-content-negotiation:$ktorVersion"
          implementation "io.ktor:ktor-serialization-kotlinx-json:$ktorVersion"
      }
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Also, add the following plugins to your build script:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```kotlin build.gradle.kts
      plugins {
          kotlin("plugin.serialization") version "your_version_of_kotlin"
          id("com.github.johnrengelman.shadow") version "8.1.1"
      }
      ```

      ```groovy build.gradle
      plugins {
          id 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.serialization' version 'your_version_of_kotlin'
          id 'com.github.johnrengelman.shadow' version '8.1.1'
      }
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Now let’s dive into building your server.

    Add a server initialization function:

    ```kotlin
    // Main function to run the MCP server
    fun `run mcp server`() {
        // Create the MCP Server instance with a basic implementation
        val server = Server(
            Implementation(
                name = "weather", // Tool name is "weather"
                version = "1.0.0" // Version of the implementation
            ),
            ServerOptions(
                capabilities = ServerCapabilities(tools = ServerCapabilities.Tools(listChanged = true))
            )
        )

        // Create a transport using standard IO for server communication
        val transport = StdioServerTransport(
            System.`in`.asInput(),
            System.out.asSink().buffered()
        )

        runBlocking {
            server.connect(transport)
            val done = Job()
            server.onClose {
                done.complete()
            }
            done.join()
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Weather API helper functions

    Next, let's add functions and data classes for querying and converting responses from the National Weather Service API:

    ```kotlin
    // Extension function to fetch forecast information for given latitude and longitude
    suspend fun HttpClient.getForecast(latitude: Double, longitude: Double): List<String> {
        val points = this.get("/points/$latitude,$longitude").body<Points>()
        val forecast = this.get(points.properties.forecast).body<Forecast>()
        return forecast.properties.periods.map { period ->
            """
                ${period.name}:
                Temperature: ${period.temperature} ${period.temperatureUnit}
                Wind: ${period.windSpeed} ${period.windDirection}
                Forecast: ${period.detailedForecast}
            """.trimIndent()
        }
    }

    // Extension function to fetch weather alerts for a given state
    suspend fun HttpClient.getAlerts(state: String): List<String> {
        val alerts = this.get("/alerts/active/area/$state").body<Alert>()
        return alerts.features.map { feature ->
            """
                Event: ${feature.properties.event}
                Area: ${feature.properties.areaDesc}
                Severity: ${feature.properties.severity}
                Description: ${feature.properties.description}
                Instruction: ${feature.properties.instruction}
            """.trimIndent()
        }
    }

    @Serializable
    data class Points(
        val properties: Properties
    ) {
        @Serializable
        data class Properties(val forecast: String)
    }

    @Serializable
    data class Forecast(
        val properties: Properties
    ) {
        @Serializable
        data class Properties(val periods: List<Period>)

        @Serializable
        data class Period(
            val number: Int, val name: String, val startTime: String, val endTime: String,
            val isDaytime: Boolean, val temperature: Int, val temperatureUnit: String,
            val temperatureTrend: String, val probabilityOfPrecipitation: JsonObject,
            val windSpeed: String, val windDirection: String,
            val shortForecast: String, val detailedForecast: String,
        )
    }

    @Serializable
    data class Alert(
        val features: List<Feature>
    ) {
        @Serializable
        data class Feature(
            val properties: Properties
        )

        @Serializable
        data class Properties(
            val event: String, val areaDesc: String, val severity: String,
            val description: String, val instruction: String?,
        )
    }
    ```

    ### Implementing tool execution

    The tool execution handler is responsible for actually executing the logic of each tool. Let's add it:

    ```kotlin
    // Create an HTTP client with a default request configuration and JSON content negotiation
    val httpClient = HttpClient {
        defaultRequest {
            url("https://api.weather.gov")
            headers {
                append("Accept", "application/geo+json")
                append("User-Agent", "WeatherApiClient/1.0")
            }
            contentType(ContentType.Application.Json)
        }
        // Install content negotiation plugin for JSON serialization/deserialization
        install(ContentNegotiation) { json(Json { ignoreUnknownKeys = true }) }
    }

    // Register a tool to fetch weather alerts by state
    server.addTool(
        name = "get_alerts",
        description = """
            Get weather alerts for a US state. Input is Two-letter US state code (e.g. CA, NY)
        """.trimIndent(),
        inputSchema = Tool.Input(
            properties = buildJsonObject {
                putJsonObject("state") {
                    put("type", "string")
                    put("description", "Two-letter US state code (e.g. CA, NY)")
                }
            },
            required = listOf("state")
        )
    ) { request ->
        val state = request.arguments["state"]?.jsonPrimitive?.content
        if (state == null) {
            return@addTool CallToolResult(
                content = listOf(TextContent("The 'state' parameter is required."))
            )
        }

        val alerts = httpClient.getAlerts(state)

        CallToolResult(content = alerts.map { TextContent(it) })
    }

    // Register a tool to fetch weather forecast by latitude and longitude
    server.addTool(
        name = "get_forecast",
        description = """
            Get weather forecast for a specific latitude/longitude
        """.trimIndent(),
        inputSchema = Tool.Input(
            properties = buildJsonObject {
                putJsonObject("latitude") { put("type", "number") }
                putJsonObject("longitude") { put("type", "number") }
            },
            required = listOf("latitude", "longitude")
        )
    ) { request ->
        val latitude = request.arguments["latitude"]?.jsonPrimitive?.doubleOrNull
        val longitude = request.arguments["longitude"]?.jsonPrimitive?.doubleOrNull
        if (latitude == null || longitude == null) {
            return@addTool CallToolResult(
                content = listOf(TextContent("The 'latitude' and 'longitude' parameters are required."))
            )
        }

        val forecast = httpClient.getForecast(latitude, longitude)

        CallToolResult(content = forecast.map { TextContent(it) })
    }
    ```

    ### Running the server

    Finally, implement the main function to run the server:

    ```kotlin
    fun main() = `run mcp server`()
    ```

    Make sure to run `./gradlew build` to build your server. This is a very important step in getting your server to connect.

    Let's now test your server from an existing MCP host, Claude for Desktop.

    ## Testing your server with Claude for Desktop

    <Note>
      Claude for Desktop is not yet available on Linux. Linux users can proceed to the [Building a client](/quickstart/client) tutorial to build an MCP client that connects to the server we just built.
    </Note>

    First, make sure you have Claude for Desktop installed. [You can install the latest version
    here.](https://claude.ai/download) If you already have Claude for Desktop, **make sure it's updated to the latest version.**

    We'll need to configure Claude for Desktop for whichever MCP servers you want to use.
    To do this, open your Claude for Desktop App configuration at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor.
    Make sure to create the file if it doesn't exist.

    For example, if you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash MacOS/Linux
      code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
      ```

      ```powershell Windows
      code $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    You'll then add your servers in the `mcpServers` key.
    The MCP UI elements will only show up in Claude for Desktop if at least one server is properly configured.

    In this case, we'll add our single weather server like so:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```json MacOS/Linux
      {
          "mcpServers": {
              "weather": {
                  "command": "java",
                  "args": [
                      "-jar",
                      "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather/build/libs/weather-0.1.0-all.jar"
                  ]
              }
          }
      }
      ```

      ```json Windows
      {
          "mcpServers": {
              "weather": {
                  "command": "java",
                  "args": [
                      "-jar",
                      "C:\\PATH\\TO\\PARENT\\FOLDER\\weather\\build\\libs\\weather-0.1.0-all.jar"
                  ]
              }
          }
      }
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    This tells Claude for Desktop:

    1. There's an MCP server named "weather"
    2. Launch it by running `java -jar /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather/build/libs/weather-0.1.0-all.jar`

    Save the file, and restart **Claude for Desktop**.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="C#">
    Let's get started with building our weather server! [You can find the complete code for what we'll be building here.](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk/tree/main/samples/QuickstartWeatherServer)

    ### Prerequisite knowledge

    This quickstart assumes you have familiarity with:

    * C#
    * LLMs like Claude
    * .NET 8 or higher

    ### System requirements

    * [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or higher installed.

    ### Set up your environment

    First, let's install `dotnet` if you haven't already. You can download `dotnet` from [official Microsoft .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/). Verify your `dotnet` installation:

    ```bash
    dotnet --version
    ```

    Now, let's create and set up your project:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash MacOS/Linux
      # Create a new directory for our project
      mkdir weather
      cd weather
      # Initialize a new C# project
      dotnet new console
      ```

      ```powershell Windows
      # Create a new directory for our project
      mkdir weather
      cd weather
      # Initialize a new C# project
      dotnet new console
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    After running `dotnet new console`, you will be presented with a new C# project.
    You can open the project in your favorite IDE, such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).
    Alternatively, you can create a C# application using the [Visual Studio project wizard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-console?view=vs-2022).
    After creating the project, add NuGet package for the Model Context Protocol SDK and hosting:

    ```bash
    # Add the Model Context Protocol SDK NuGet package
    dotnet add package ModelContextProtocol --prerelease
    # Add the .NET Hosting NuGet package
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting
    ```

    Now let’s dive into building your server.

    ## Building your server

    Open the `Program.cs` file in your project and replace its contents with the following code:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
    using ModelContextProtocol;
    using System.Net.Http.Headers;

    var builder = Host.CreateEmptyApplicationBuilder(settings: null);

    builder.Services.AddMcpServer()
        .WithStdioServerTransport()
        .WithToolsFromAssembly();

    builder.Services.AddSingleton(_ =>
    {
        var client = new HttpClient() { BaseAddress = new Uri("https://api.weather.gov") };
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.UserAgent.Add(new ProductInfoHeaderValue("weather-tool", "1.0"));
        return client;
    });

    var app = builder.Build();

    await app.RunAsync();
    ```

    <Note>
      When creating the `ApplicationHostBuilder`, ensure you use `CreateEmptyApplicationBuilder` instead of `CreateDefaultBuilder`. This ensures that the server does not write any additional messages to the console. This is only neccessary for servers using STDIO transport.
    </Note>

    This code sets up a basic console application that uses the Model Context Protocol SDK to create an MCP server with standard I/O transport.

    ### Weather API helper functions

    Next, define a class with the tool execution handlers for querying and converting responses from the National Weather Service API:

    ```csharp
    using ModelContextProtocol.Server;
    using System.ComponentModel;
    using System.Net.Http.Json;
    using System.Text.Json;

    namespace QuickstartWeatherServer.Tools;

    [McpServerToolType]
    public static class WeatherTools
    {
        [McpServerTool, Description("Get weather alerts for a US state.")]
        public static async Task<string> GetAlerts(
            HttpClient client,
            [Description("The US state to get alerts for.")] string state)
        {
            var jsonElement = await client.GetFromJsonAsync<JsonElement>($"/alerts/active/area/{state}");
            var alerts = jsonElement.GetProperty("features").EnumerateArray();

            if (!alerts.Any())
            {
                return "No active alerts for this state.";
            }

            return string.Join("\n--\n", alerts.Select(alert =>
            {
                JsonElement properties = alert.GetProperty("properties");
                return $"""
                        Event: {properties.GetProperty("event").GetString()}
                        Area: {properties.GetProperty("areaDesc").GetString()}
                        Severity: {properties.GetProperty("severity").GetString()}
                        Description: {properties.GetProperty("description").GetString()}
                        Instruction: {properties.GetProperty("instruction").GetString()}
                        """;
            }));
        }

        [McpServerTool, Description("Get weather forecast for a location.")]
        public static async Task<string> GetForecast(
            HttpClient client,
            [Description("Latitude of the location.")] double latitude,
            [Description("Longitude of the location.")] double longitude)
        {
            var jsonElement = await client.GetFromJsonAsync<JsonElement>($"/points/{latitude},{longitude}");
            var periods = jsonElement.GetProperty("properties").GetProperty("periods").EnumerateArray();

            return string.Join("\n---\n", periods.Select(period => $"""
                    {period.GetProperty("name").GetString()}
                    Temperature: {period.GetProperty("temperature").GetInt32()}°F
                    Wind: {period.GetProperty("windSpeed").GetString()} {period.GetProperty("windDirection").GetString()}
                    Forecast: {period.GetProperty("detailedForecast").GetString()}
                    """));
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Running the server

    Finally, run the server using the following command:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

    This will start the server and listen for incoming requests on standard input/output.

    ## Testing your server with Claude for Desktop

    <Note>
      Claude for Desktop is not yet available on Linux. Linux users can proceed to the [Building a client](/quickstart/client) tutorial to build an MCP client that connects to the server we just built.
    </Note>

    First, make sure you have Claude for Desktop installed. [You can install the latest version
    here.](https://claude.ai/download) If you already have Claude for Desktop, **make sure it's updated to the latest version.**
    We'll need to configure Claude for Desktop for whichever MCP servers you want to use. To do this, open your Claude for Desktop App configuration at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor. Make sure to create the file if it doesn't exist.
    For example, if you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="MacOS/Linux">
        ```bash
        code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Windows">
        ```powershell
        code $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    You'll then add your servers in the `mcpServers` key. The MCP UI elements will only show up in Claude for Desktop if at least one server is properly configured.
    In this case, we'll add our single weather server like so:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="MacOS/Linux">
        ```json
        {
            "mcpServers": {
                "weather": {
                    "command": "dotnet",
                    "args": [
                        "run",
                        "--project",
                        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PROJECT",
                        "--no-build"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Windows">
        ```json
        {
            "mcpServers": {
                "weather": {
                    "command": "dotnet",
                    "args": [
                        "run",
                        "--project",
                        "C:\\ABSOLUTE\\PATH\\TO\\PROJECT",
                        "--no-build"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    This tells Claude for Desktop:

    1. There's an MCP server named "weather"
    2. Launch it by running `dotnet run /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PROJECT`
       Save the file, and restart **Claude for Desktop**.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Test with commands

Let's make sure Claude for Desktop is picking up the two tools we've exposed in our `weather` server. You can do this by looking for the hammer <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/claude-desktop-mcp-hammer-icon.svg" style={{display: 'inline', margin: 0, height: '1.3em'}} /> icon:

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/visual-indicator-mcp-tools.png" />
</Frame>

After clicking on the hammer icon, you should see two tools listed:

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/available-mcp-tools.png" />
</Frame>

If your server isn't being picked up by Claude for Desktop, proceed to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for debugging tips.

If the hammer icon has shown up, you can now test your server by running the following commands in Claude for Desktop:

* What's the weather in Sacramento?
* What are the active weather alerts in Texas?

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/current-weather.png" />
</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/weather-alerts.png" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Since this is the US National Weather service, the queries will only work for US locations.
</Note>

## What's happening under the hood

When you ask a question:

1. The client sends your question to Claude
2. Claude analyzes the available tools and decides which one(s) to use
3. The client executes the chosen tool(s) through the MCP server
4. The results are sent back to Claude
5. Claude formulates a natural language response
6. The response is displayed to you!

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Claude for Desktop Integration Issues">
    **Getting logs from Claude for Desktop**

    Claude.app logging related to MCP is written to log files in `~/Library/Logs/Claude`:

    * `mcp.log` will contain general logging about MCP connections and connection failures.
    * Files named `mcp-server-SERVERNAME.log` will contain error (stderr) logging from the named server.

    You can run the following command to list recent logs and follow along with any new ones:

    ```bash
    # Check Claude's logs for errors
    tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
    ```

    **Server not showing up in Claude**

    1. Check your `claude_desktop_config.json` file syntax
    2. Make sure the path to your project is absolute and not relative
    3. Restart Claude for Desktop completely

    **Tool calls failing silently**

    If Claude attempts to use the tools but they fail:

    1. Check Claude's logs for errors
    2. Verify your server builds and runs without errors
    3. Try restarting Claude for Desktop

    **None of this is working. What do I do?**

  <Accordion title="Weather API Issues">
    **Error: Failed to retrieve grid point data**

    This usually means either:

    1. The coordinates are outside the US
    2. The NWS API is having issues
    3. You're being rate limited

    Fix:

    * Verify you're using US coordinates
    * Add a small delay between requests
    * Check the NWS API status page

    **Error: No active alerts for \[STATE]**

    This isn't an error - it just means there are no current weather alerts for that state. Try a different state or check during severe weather.

  <Tab title="Python">
    [You can find the complete code for this tutorial here.](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/quickstart-resources/tree/main/mcp-client-python)

    ## System Requirements

    Before starting, ensure your system meets these requirements:

    * Mac or Windows computer
    * Latest Python version installed
    * Latest version of `uv` installed

    ## Setting Up Your Environment

    First, create a new Python project with `uv`:

    ```bash
    # Create project directory
    uv init mcp-client
    cd mcp-client

    # Create virtual environment
    uv venv

    # Activate virtual environment
    # On Windows:
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    # On Unix or MacOS:
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Install required packages
    uv add mcp anthropic python-dotenv

    # Remove boilerplate files
    # On Windows:
    del main.py
    # On Unix or MacOS:
    rm main.py

    # Create our main file
    touch client.py
    ```

    ## Setting Up Your API Key

    You'll need an Anthropic API key from the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).

    Create a `.env` file to store it:

    ```bash
    # Create .env file
    touch .env
    ```

    Add your key to the `.env` file:

    ```bash
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your key here>
    ```

    Add `.env` to your `.gitignore`:

    ```bash
    echo ".env" >> .gitignore
    ```

    <Warning>
      Make sure you keep your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secure!
    </Warning>

    ## Creating the Client

    ### Basic Client Structure

    First, let's set up our imports and create the basic client class:

    ```python
    import asyncio
    from typing import Optional
    from contextlib import AsyncExitStack

    from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
    from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client

    from anthropic import Anthropic
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    load_dotenv()  # load environment variables from .env

    class MCPClient:
        def __init__(self):
            # Initialize session and client objects
            self.session: Optional[ClientSession] = None
            self.exit_stack = AsyncExitStack()
            self.anthropic = Anthropic()
        # methods will go here
    ```

    ### Server Connection Management

    Next, we'll implement the method to connect to an MCP server:

    ```python
    async def connect_to_server(self, server_script_path: str):
        """Connect to an MCP server

        Args:
            server_script_path: Path to the server script (.py or .js)
        """
        is_python = server_script_path.endswith('.py')
        is_js = server_script_path.endswith('.js')
        if not (is_python or is_js):
            raise ValueError("Server script must be a .py or .js file")

        command = "python" if is_python else "node"
        server_params = StdioServerParameters(
            command=command,
            args=[server_script_path],
            env=None
        )

        stdio_transport = await self.exit_stack.enter_async_context(stdio_client(server_params))
        self.stdio, self.write = stdio_transport
        self.session = await self.exit_stack.enter_async_context(ClientSession(self.stdio, self.write))

        await self.session.initialize()

        # List available tools
        response = await self.session.list_tools()
        tools = response.tools
        print("\nConnected to server with tools:", [tool.name for tool in tools])
    ```

    ### Query Processing Logic

    Now let's add the core functionality for processing queries and handling tool calls:

    ```python
    async def process_query(self, query: str) -> str:
        """Process a query using Claude and available tools"""
        messages = [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": query
            }
        ]

        response = await self.session.list_tools()
        available_tools = [{
            "name": tool.name,
            "description": tool.description,
            "input_schema": tool.inputSchema
        } for tool in response.tools]

        # Initial Claude API call
        response = self.anthropic.messages.create(
            model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
            max_tokens=1000,
            messages=messages,
            tools=available_tools
        )

        # Process response and handle tool calls
        final_text = []

        assistant_message_content = []
        for content in response.content:
            if content.type == 'text':
                final_text.append(content.text)
                assistant_message_content.append(content)
            elif content.type == 'tool_use':
                tool_name = content.name
                tool_args = content.input

                # Execute tool call
                result = await self.session.call_tool(tool_name, tool_args)
                final_text.append(f"[Calling tool {tool_name} with args {tool_args}]")

                assistant_message_content.append(content)
                messages.append({
                    "role": "assistant",
                    "content": assistant_message_content
                })
                messages.append({
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": [
                        {
                            "type": "tool_result",
                            "tool_use_id": content.id,
                            "content": result.content
                        }
                    ]
                })

                # Get next response from Claude
                response = self.anthropic.messages.create(
                    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
                    max_tokens=1000,
                    messages=messages,
                    tools=available_tools
                )

                final_text.append(response.content[0].text)

        return "\n".join(final_text)
    ```

    ### Interactive Chat Interface

    Now we'll add the chat loop and cleanup functionality:

    ```python
    async def chat_loop(self):
        """Run an interactive chat loop"""
        print("\nMCP Client Started!")
        print("Type your queries or 'quit' to exit.")

        while True:
            try:
                query = input("\nQuery: ").strip()

                if query.lower() == 'quit':
                    break

                response = await self.process_query(query)
                print("\n" + response)

            except Exception as e:
                print(f"\nError: {str(e)}")

    async def cleanup(self):
        """Clean up resources"""
        await self.exit_stack.aclose()
    ```

    ### Main Entry Point

    Finally, we'll add the main execution logic:

    ```python
    async def main():
        if len(sys.argv) < 2:
            print("Usage: python client.py <path_to_server_script>")
            sys.exit(1)

        client = MCPClient()
        try:
            await client.connect_to_server(sys.argv[1])
            await client.chat_loop()
        finally:
            await client.cleanup()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        import sys
        asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    You can find the complete `client.py` file [here.](https://gist.github.com/zckly/f3f28ea731e096e53b39b47bf0a2d4b1)

    ## Key Components Explained

    ### 1. Client Initialization

    * The `MCPClient` class initializes with session management and API clients
    * Uses `AsyncExitStack` for proper resource management
    * Configures the Anthropic client for Claude interactions

    ### 2. Server Connection

    * Supports both Python and Node.js servers
    * Validates server script type
    * Sets up proper communication channels
    * Initializes the session and lists available tools

    ### 3. Query Processing

    * Maintains conversation context
    * Handles Claude's responses and tool calls
    * Manages the message flow between Claude and tools
    * Combines results into a coherent response

    ### 4. Interactive Interface

    * Provides a simple command-line interface
    * Handles user input and displays responses
    * Includes basic error handling
    * Allows graceful exit

    ### 5. Resource Management

    * Proper cleanup of resources
    * Error handling for connection issues
    * Graceful shutdown procedures

    ## Common Customization Points

    1. **Tool Handling**
       * Modify `process_query()` to handle specific tool types
       * Add custom error handling for tool calls
       * Implement tool-specific response formatting

    2. **Response Processing**
       * Customize how tool results are formatted
       * Add response filtering or transformation
       * Implement custom logging

    3. **User Interface**
       * Add a GUI or web interface
       * Implement rich console output
       * Add command history or auto-completion

    ## Running the Client

    To run your client with any MCP server:

    ```bash
    uv run client.py path/to/server.py # python server
    uv run client.py path/to/build/index.js # node server
    ```

    <Note>
      If you're continuing the weather tutorial from the server quickstart, your command might look something like this: `python client.py .../quickstart-resources/weather-server-python/weather.py`
    </Note>

    The client will:

    1. Connect to the specified server
    2. List available tools
    3. Start an interactive chat session where you can:
       * Enter queries
       * See tool executions
       * Get responses from Claude

    Here's an example of what it should look like if connected to the weather server from the server quickstart:

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/client-claude-cli-python.png" />
    </Frame>

    ## How It Works

    When you submit a query:

    1. The client gets the list of available tools from the server
    2. Your query is sent to Claude along with tool descriptions
    3. Claude decides which tools (if any) to use
    4. The client executes any requested tool calls through the server
    5. Results are sent back to Claude
    6. Claude provides a natural language response
    7. The response is displayed to you

    ## Best practices

    1. **Error Handling**
       * Always wrap tool calls in try-catch blocks
       * Provide meaningful error messages
       * Gracefully handle connection issues

    2. **Resource Management**
       * Use `AsyncExitStack` for proper cleanup
       * Close connections when done
       * Handle server disconnections

    3. **Security**
       * Store API keys securely in `.env`
       * Validate server responses
       * Be cautious with tool permissions

    ## Troubleshooting

    ### Server Path Issues

    * Double-check the path to your server script is correct
    * Use the absolute path if the relative path isn't working
    * For Windows users, make sure to use forward slashes (/) or escaped backslashes (\\) in the path
    * Verify the server file has the correct extension (.py for Python or .js for Node.js)

    Example of correct path usage:

    ```bash
    # Relative path
    uv run client.py ./server/weather.py

    # Absolute path
    uv run client.py /Users/username/projects/mcp-server/weather.py

    # Windows path (either format works)
    uv run client.py C:/projects/mcp-server/weather.py
    uv run client.py C:\\projects\\mcp-server\\weather.py
    ```

    ### Response Timing

    * The first response might take up to 30 seconds to return
    * This is normal and happens while:
      * The server initializes
      * Claude processes the query
      * Tools are being executed
    * Subsequent responses are typically faster
    * Don't interrupt the process during this initial waiting period

    ### Common Error Messages

    If you see:

    * `FileNotFoundError`: Check your server path
    * `Connection refused`: Ensure the server is running and the path is correct
    * `Tool execution failed`: Verify the tool's required environment variables are set
    * `Timeout error`: Consider increasing the timeout in your client configuration

    ## System Requirements

    Before starting, ensure your system meets these requirements:

    * Mac or Windows computer
    * Node.js 17 or higher installed
    * Latest version of `npm` installed
    * Anthropic API key (Claude)

    ## Setting Up Your Environment

    First, let's create and set up our project:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash MacOS/Linux
      # Create project directory
      mkdir mcp-client-typescript
      cd mcp-client-typescript

      # Initialize npm project
      npm init -y

      # Install dependencies
      npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk @modelcontextprotocol/sdk dotenv

      # Install dev dependencies
      npm install -D @types/node typescript

      # Create source file
      touch index.ts
      ```

      ```powershell Windows
      # Create project directory
      md mcp-client-typescript
      cd mcp-client-typescript

      # Initialize npm project
      npm init -y

      # Install dependencies
      npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk @modelcontextprotocol/sdk dotenv

      # Install dev dependencies
      npm install -D @types/node typescript

      # Create source file
      new-item index.ts
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Update your `package.json` to set `type: "module"` and a build script:

    ```json package.json
    {
      "type": "module",
      "scripts": {
        "build": "tsc && chmod 755 build/index.js"
      }
    }
    ```

    Create a `tsconfig.json` in the root of your project:

    ```json tsconfig.json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "ES2022",
        "module": "Node16",
        "moduleResolution": "Node16",
        "outDir": "./build",
        "rootDir": "./",
        "strict": true,
        "esModuleInterop": true,
        "skipLibCheck": true,
        "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
      },
      "include": ["index.ts"],
      "exclude": ["node_modules"]
    }
    ```

    ## Setting Up Your API Key

    You'll need an Anthropic API key from the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).

    Create a `.env` file to store it:

    ```bash
    echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your key here>" > .env
    ```

    Add `.env` to your `.gitignore`:

    ```bash
    echo ".env" >> .gitignore
    ```

    <Warning>
      Make sure you keep your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secure!
    </Warning>

    ## Creating the Client

    ### Basic Client Structure

    First, let's set up our imports and create the basic client class in `index.ts`:

    ```typescript
    import { Anthropic } from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";
    import {
      MessageParam,
      Tool,
    } from "@anthropic-ai/sdk/resources/messages/messages.mjs";
    import { Client } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js";
    import { StdioClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js";
    import readline from "readline/promises";
    import dotenv from "dotenv";

    dotenv.config();

    const ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY;
    if (!ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) {
      throw new Error("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not set");
    }

    class MCPClient {
      private mcp: Client;
      private anthropic: Anthropic;
      private transport: StdioClientTransport | null = null;
      private tools: Tool[] = [];

      constructor() {
        this.anthropic = new Anthropic({
          apiKey: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
        });
        this.mcp = new Client({ name: "mcp-client-cli", version: "1.0.0" });
      }
      // methods will go here
    }
    ```

    ### Server Connection Management

    Next, we'll implement the method to connect to an MCP server:

    ```typescript
    async connectToServer(serverScriptPath: string) {
      try {
        const isJs = serverScriptPath.endsWith(".js");
        const isPy = serverScriptPath.endsWith(".py");
        if (!isJs && !isPy) {
          throw new Error("Server script must be a .js or .py file");
        }
        const command = isPy
          ? process.platform === "win32"
            ? "python"
            : "python3"
          : process.execPath;

        this.transport = new StdioClientTransport({
          command,
          args: [serverScriptPath],
        });
        this.mcp.connect(this.transport);

        const toolsResult = await this.mcp.listTools();
        this.tools = toolsResult.tools.map((tool) => {
          return {
            name: tool.name,
            description: tool.description,
            input_schema: tool.inputSchema,
          };
        });
        console.log(
          "Connected to server with tools:",
          this.tools.map(({ name }) => name)
        );
      } catch (e) {
        console.log("Failed to connect to MCP server: ", e);
        throw e;
      }
    }
    ```

    ### Query Processing Logic

    Now let's add the core functionality for processing queries and handling tool calls:

    ```typescript
    async processQuery(query: string) {
      const messages: MessageParam[] = [
        {
          role: "user",
          content: query,
        },
      ];

      const response = await this.anthropic.messages.create({
        model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
        max_tokens: 1000,
        messages,
        tools: this.tools,
      });

      const finalText = [];
      const toolResults = [];

      for (const content of response.content) {
        if (content.type === "text") {
          finalText.push(content.text);
        } else if (content.type === "tool_use") {
          const toolName = content.name;
          const toolArgs = content.input as { [x: string]: unknown } | undefined;

          const result = await this.mcp.callTool({
            name: toolName,
            arguments: toolArgs,
          });
          toolResults.push(result);
          finalText.push(
            `[Calling tool ${toolName} with args ${JSON.stringify(toolArgs)}]`
          );

          messages.push({
            role: "user",
            content: result.content as string,
          });

          const response = await this.anthropic.messages.create({
            model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
            max_tokens: 1000,
            messages,
          });

          finalText.push(
            response.content[0].type === "text" ? response.content[0].text : ""
          );
        }
      }

      return finalText.join("\n");
    }
    ```

    ### Interactive Chat Interface

    Now we'll add the chat loop and cleanup functionality:

    ```typescript
    async chatLoop() {
      const rl = readline.createInterface({
        input: process.stdin,
        output: process.stdout,
      });

      try {
        console.log("\nMCP Client Started!");
        console.log("Type your queries or 'quit' to exit.");

        while (true) {
          const message = await rl.question("\nQuery: ");
          if (message.toLowerCase() === "quit") {
            break;
          }
          const response = await this.processQuery(message);
          console.log("\n" + response);
        }
      } finally {
        rl.close();
      }
    }

    async cleanup() {
      await this.mcp.close();
    }
    ```

    ### Main Entry Point

    Finally, we'll add the main execution logic:

    ```typescript
    async function main() {
      if (process.argv.length < 3) {
        console.log("Usage: node index.ts <path_to_server_script>");
        return;
      }
      const mcpClient = new MCPClient();
      try {
        await mcpClient.connectToServer(process.argv[2]);
        await mcpClient.chatLoop();
      } finally {
        await mcpClient.cleanup();
        process.exit(0);
      }
    }

    main();
    ```

    ## Running the Client

    To run your client with any MCP server:

    ```bash
    # Build TypeScript
    npm run build

    # Run the client
    node build/index.js path/to/server.py # python server
    node build/index.js path/to/build/index.js # node server
    ```

    <Note>
      If you're continuing the weather tutorial from the server quickstart, your command might look something like this: `node build/index.js .../quickstart-resources/weather-server-typescript/build/index.js`
    </Note>

    **The client will:**

    1. Connect to the specified server
    2. List available tools
    3. Start an interactive chat session where you can:
       * Enter queries
       * See tool executions
       * Get responses from Claude

    ## How It Works

    When you submit a query:

    1. The client gets the list of available tools from the server
    2. Your query is sent to Claude along with tool descriptions
    3. Claude decides which tools (if any) to use
    4. The client executes any requested tool calls through the server
    5. Results are sent back to Claude
    6. Claude provides a natural language response
    7. The response is displayed to you

    ## Best practices

    1. **Error Handling**
       * Use TypeScript's type system for better error detection
       * Wrap tool calls in try-catch blocks
       * Provide meaningful error messages
       * Gracefully handle connection issues

    2. **Security**
       * Store API keys securely in `.env`
       * Validate server responses
       * Be cautious with tool permissions

    ## Troubleshooting

    ### Server Path Issues

    * Double-check the path to your server script is correct
    * Use the absolute path if the relative path isn't working
    * For Windows users, make sure to use forward slashes (/) or escaped backslashes (\\) in the path
    * Verify the server file has the correct extension (.js for Node.js or .py for Python)

    Example of correct path usage:

    ```bash
    # Relative path
    node build/index.js ./server/build/index.js

    # Absolute path
    node build/index.js /Users/username/projects/mcp-server/build/index.js

    # Windows path (either format works)
    node build/index.js C:/projects/mcp-server/build/index.js
    node build/index.js C:\\projects\\mcp-server\\build\\index.js
    ```

    ### Response Timing

    * The first response might take up to 30 seconds to return
    * This is normal and happens while:
      * The server initializes
      * Claude processes the query
      * Tools are being executed
    * Subsequent responses are typically faster
    * Don't interrupt the process during this initial waiting period

    ### Common Error Messages

    If you see:

    * `Error: Cannot find module`: Check your build folder and ensure TypeScript compilation succeeded
    * `Connection refused`: Ensure the server is running and the path is correct
    * `Tool execution failed`: Verify the tool's required environment variables are set
    * `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not set`: Check your .env file and environment variables
    * `TypeError`: Ensure you're using the correct types for tool arguments

    <Note>
      This is a quickstart demo based on Spring AI MCP auto-configuration and boot starters.
      To learn how to create sync and async MCP Clients manually, consult the [Java SDK Client](/sdk/java/mcp-client) documentation
    </Note>

    This example demonstrates how to build an interactive chatbot that combines Spring AI's Model Context Protocol (MCP) with the [Brave Search MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/brave-search). The application creates a conversational interface powered by Anthropic's Claude AI model that can perform internet searches through Brave Search, enabling natural language interactions with real-time web data.
    [You can find the complete code for this tutorial here.](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/tree/main/model-context-protocol/web-search/brave-chatbot)

    ## System Requirements

    Before starting, ensure your system meets these requirements:

    * Java 17 or higher
    * Maven 3.6+
    * npx package manager
    * Anthropic API key (Claude)
    * Brave Search API key

    ## Setting Up Your Environment

    1. Install npx (Node Package eXecute):
       First, make sure to install [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
       and then run:
       ```bash
       npm install -g npx
       ```

    2. Clone the repository:
       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples.git
       cd model-context-protocol/brave-chatbot
       ```

    3. Set up your API keys:
       ```bash
       export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-anthropic-api-key-here'
       export BRAVE_API_KEY='your-brave-api-key-here'
       ```

    4. Build the application:
       ```bash
       ./mvnw clean install
       ```

    5. Run the application using Maven:
       ```bash
       ./mvnw spring-boot:run
       ```

    <Warning>
      Make sure you keep your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `BRAVE_API_KEY` keys secure!
    </Warning>

    ## How it Works

    The application integrates Spring AI with the Brave Search MCP server through several components:

    ### MCP Client Configuration

    1. Required dependencies in pom.xml:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-ai-starter-mcp-client</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-ai-starter-model-anthropic</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```

    2. Application properties (application.yml):

    ```yml
    spring:
      ai:
        mcp:
          client:
            enabled: true
            name: brave-search-client
            version: 1.0.0
            type: SYNC
            request-timeout: 20s
            stdio:
              root-change-notification: true
              servers-configuration: classpath:/mcp-servers-config.json
            toolcallback:
              enabled: true
        anthropic:
          api-key: ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
    ```

    This activates the `spring-ai-starter-mcp-client` to create one or more `McpClient`s based on the provided server configuration.
    The `spring.ai.mcp.client.toolcallback.enabled=true` property enables the tool callback mechanism, that automatically registers all MCP tool as spring ai tools.
    It is disabled by default.

    3. MCP Server Configuration (`mcp-servers-config.json`):

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "brave-search": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "-y",
            "@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search"
          ],
          "env": {
            "BRAVE_API_KEY": "<PUT YOUR BRAVE API KEY>"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    ### Chat Implementation

    The chatbot is implemented using Spring AI's ChatClient with MCP tool integration:

    ```java
    var chatClient = chatClientBuilder
        .defaultSystem("You are useful assistant, expert in AI and Java.")
        .defaultTools((Object[]) mcpToolAdapter.toolCallbacks())
        .defaultAdvisors(new MessageChatMemoryAdvisor(new InMemoryChatMemory()))
        .build();
    ```

    Key features:

    * Uses Claude AI model for natural language understanding
    * Integrates Brave Search through MCP for real-time web search capabilities
    * Maintains conversation memory using InMemoryChatMemory
    * Runs as an interactive command-line application

    ### Build and run

    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    java -jar ./target/ai-mcp-brave-chatbot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

    The application will start an interactive chat session where you can ask questions. The chatbot will use Brave Search when it needs to find information from the internet to answer your queries.

    The chatbot can:

    * Answer questions using its built-in knowledge
    * Perform web searches when needed using Brave Search
    * Remember context from previous messages in the conversation
    * Combine information from multiple sources to provide comprehensive answers

    ### Advanced Configuration

    The MCP client supports additional configuration options:

    * Client customization through `McpSyncClientCustomizer` or `McpAsyncClientCustomizer`
    * Multiple clients with multiple transport types: `STDIO` and `SSE` (Server-Sent Events)
    * Integration with Spring AI's tool execution framework
    * Automatic client initialization and lifecycle management

    For WebFlux-based applications, you can use the WebFlux starter instead:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-ai-mcp-client-webflux-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```

    This provides similar functionality but uses a WebFlux-based SSE transport implementation, recommended for production deployments.

    [You can find the complete code for this tutorial here.](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/kotlin-sdk/tree/main/samples/kotlin-mcp-client)

    ## System Requirements

    Before starting, ensure your system meets these requirements:

    * Java 17 or higher
    * Anthropic API key (Claude)

    ## Setting up your environment

    First, let's install `java` and `gradle` if you haven't already.
    You can download `java` from [official Oracle JDK website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
    Verify your `java` installation:

    ```bash
    java --version
    ```

    Now, let's create and set up your project:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash MacOS/Linux
      # Create a new directory for our project
      mkdir kotlin-mcp-client
      cd kotlin-mcp-client

      # Initialize a new kotlin project
      gradle init
      ```

      ```powershell Windows
      # Create a new directory for our project
      md kotlin-mcp-client
      cd kotlin-mcp-client
      # Initialize a new kotlin project
      gradle init
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    After running `gradle init`, you will be presented with options for creating your project.
    Select **Application** as the project type, **Kotlin** as the programming language, and **Java 17** as the Java version.

    Alternatively, you can create a Kotlin application using the [IntelliJ IDEA project wizard](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/jvm-get-started.html).

    After creating the project, add the following dependencies:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```kotlin build.gradle.kts
      val mcpVersion = "0.4.0"
      val slf4jVersion = "2.0.9"
      val anthropicVersion = "0.8.0"

      dependencies {
          implementation("io.modelcontextprotocol:kotlin-sdk:$mcpVersion")
          implementation("org.slf4j:slf4j-nop:$slf4jVersion")
          implementation("com.anthropic:anthropic-java:$anthropicVersion")
      }
      ```

      ```groovy build.gradle
      def mcpVersion = '0.3.0'
      def slf4jVersion = '2.0.9'
      def anthropicVersion = '0.8.0'
      dependencies {
          implementation "io.modelcontextprotocol:kotlin-sdk:$mcpVersion"
          implementation "org.slf4j:slf4j-nop:$slf4jVersion"
          implementation "com.anthropic:anthropic-java:$anthropicVersion"
      }
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Also, add the following plugins to your build script:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```kotlin build.gradle.kts
      plugins {
          id("com.github.johnrengelman.shadow") version "8.1.1"
      }
      ```

      ```groovy build.gradle
      plugins {
          id 'com.github.johnrengelman.shadow' version '8.1.1'
      }
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    ## Setting up your API key

    You'll need an Anthropic API key from the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).

    Set up your API key:

    ```bash
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-anthropic-api-key-here'
    ```

    <Warning>
      Make sure your keep your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secure!
    </Warning>

    ## Creating the Client

    ### Basic Client Structure

    First, let's create the basic client class:

    ```kotlin
    class MCPClient : AutoCloseable {
        private val anthropic = AnthropicOkHttpClient.fromEnv()
        private val mcp: Client = Client(clientInfo = Implementation(name = "mcp-client-cli", version = "1.0.0"))
        private lateinit var tools: List<ToolUnion>

        // methods will go here

        override fun close() {
            runBlocking {
                mcp.close()
                anthropic.close()
            }
        }
    ```

    ### Server connection management

    Next, we'll implement the method to connect to an MCP server:

    ```kotlin
    suspend fun connectToServer(serverScriptPath: String) {
        try {
            val command = buildList {
                when (serverScriptPath.substringAfterLast(".")) {
                    "js" -> add("node")
                    "py" -> add(if (System.getProperty("os.name").lowercase().contains("win")) "python" else "python3")
                    "jar" -> addAll(listOf("java", "-jar"))
                    else -> throw IllegalArgumentException("Server script must be a .js, .py or .jar file")
                }
                add(serverScriptPath)
            }

            val process = ProcessBuilder(command).start()
            val transport = StdioClientTransport(
                input = process.inputStream.asSource().buffered(),
                output = process.outputStream.asSink().buffered()
            )

            mcp.connect(transport)

            val toolsResult = mcp.listTools()
            tools = toolsResult?.tools?.map { tool ->
                ToolUnion.ofTool(
                    Tool.builder()
                        .name(tool.name)
                        .description(tool.description ?: "")
                        .inputSchema(
                            Tool.InputSchema.builder()
                                .type(JsonValue.from(tool.inputSchema.type))
                                .properties(tool.inputSchema.properties.toJsonValue())
                                .putAdditionalProperty("required", JsonValue.from(tool.inputSchema.required))
                                .build()
                        )
                        .build()
                )
            } ?: emptyList()
            println("Connected to server with tools: ${tools.joinToString(", ") { it.tool().get().name() }}")
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            println("Failed to connect to MCP server: $e")
            throw e
        }
    }
    ```

    Also create a helper function to convert from `JsonObject` to `JsonValue` for Anthropic:

    ```kotlin
    private fun JsonObject.toJsonValue(): JsonValue {
        val mapper = ObjectMapper()
        val node = mapper.readTree(this.toString())
        return JsonValue.fromJsonNode(node)
    }
    ```

    ### Query processing logic

    Now let's add the core functionality for processing queries and handling tool calls:

    ```kotlin
    private val messageParamsBuilder: MessageCreateParams.Builder = MessageCreateParams.builder()
        .model(Model.CLAUDE_3_5_SONNET_20241022)
        .maxTokens(1024)

    suspend fun processQuery(query: String): String {
        val messages = mutableListOf(
            MessageParam.builder()
                .role(MessageParam.Role.USER)
                .content(query)
                .build()
        )

        val response = anthropic.messages().create(
            messageParamsBuilder
                .messages(messages)
                .tools(tools)
                .build()
        )

        val finalText = mutableListOf<String>()
        response.content().forEach { content ->
            when {
                content.isText() -> finalText.add(content.text().getOrNull()?.text() ?: "")

                content.isToolUse() -> {
                    val toolName = content.toolUse().get().name()
                    val toolArgs =
                        content.toolUse().get()._input().convert(object : TypeReference<Map<String, JsonValue>>() {})

                    val result = mcp.callTool(
                        name = toolName,
                        arguments = toolArgs ?: emptyMap()
                    )
                    finalText.add("[Calling tool $toolName with args $toolArgs]")

                    messages.add(
                        MessageParam.builder()
                            .role(MessageParam.Role.USER)
                            .content(
                                """
                                    "type": "tool_result",
                                    "tool_name": $toolName,
                                    "result": ${result?.content?.joinToString("\n") { (it as TextContent).text ?: "" }}
                                """.trimIndent()
                            )
                            .build()
                    )

                    val aiResponse = anthropic.messages().create(
                        messageParamsBuilder
                            .messages(messages)
                            .build()
                    )

                    finalText.add(aiResponse.content().first().text().getOrNull()?.text() ?: "")
                }
            }
        }

        return finalText.joinToString("\n", prefix = "", postfix = "")
    }
    ```

    ### Interactive chat

    We'll add the chat loop:

    ```kotlin
    suspend fun chatLoop() {
        println("\nMCP Client Started!")
        println("Type your queries or 'quit' to exit.")

        while (true) {
            print("\nQuery: ")
            val message = readLine() ?: break
            if (message.lowercase() == "quit") break
            val response = processQuery(message)
            println("\n$response")
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Main entry point

    Finally, we'll add the main execution function:

    ```kotlin
    fun main(args: Array<String>) = runBlocking {
        if (args.isEmpty()) throw IllegalArgumentException("Usage: java -jar <your_path>/build/libs/kotlin-mcp-client-0.1.0-all.jar <path_to_server_script>")
        val serverPath = args.first()
        val client = MCPClient()
        client.use {
            client.connectToServer(serverPath)
            client.chatLoop()
        }
    }
    ```

    ## Running the client

    To run your client with any MCP server:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew build

    # Run the client
    java -jar build/libs/<your-jar-name>.jar path/to/server.jar # jvm server
    java -jar build/libs/<your-jar-name>.jar path/to/server.py # python server
    java -jar build/libs/<your-jar-name>.jar path/to/build/index.js # node server
    ```

    <Note>
      If you're continuing the weather tutorial from the server quickstart, your command might look something like this: `java -jar build/libs/kotlin-mcp-client-0.1.0-all.jar .../samples/weather-stdio-server/build/libs/weather-stdio-server-0.1.0-all.jar`
    </Note>

    **The client will:**

    1. Connect to the specified server
    2. List available tools
    3. Start an interactive chat session where you can:
       * Enter queries
       * See tool executions
       * Get responses from Claude

    ## How it works

    Here's a high-level workflow schema:

    ```mermaid
    ---
    config:
        theme: neutral
    ---
    sequenceDiagram
        actor User
        participant Client
        participant Claude
        participant MCP_Server as MCP Server
        participant Tools

        User->>Client: Send query
        Client<<->>MCP_Server: Get available tools
        Client->>Claude: Send query with tool descriptions
        Claude-->>Client: Decide tool execution
        Client->>MCP_Server: Request tool execution
        MCP_Server->>Tools: Execute chosen tools
        Tools-->>MCP_Server: Return results
        MCP_Server-->>Client: Send results
        Client->>Claude: Send tool results
        Claude-->>Client: Provide final response
        Client-->>User: Display response
    ```

    When you submit a query:

    1. The client gets the list of available tools from the server
    2. Your query is sent to Claude along with tool descriptions
    3. Claude decides which tools (if any) to use
    4. The client executes any requested tool calls through the server
    5. Results are sent back to Claude
    6. Claude provides a natural language response
    7. The response is displayed to you

    ## Best practices

    1. **Error Handling**
       * Leverage Kotlin's type system to model errors explicitly
       * Wrap external tool and API calls in `try-catch` blocks when exceptions are possible
       * Provide clear and meaningful error messages
       * Handle network timeouts and connection issues gracefully

    2. **Security**
       * Store API keys and secrets securely in `local.properties`, environment variables, or secret managers
       * Validate all external responses to avoid unexpected or unsafe data usage
       * Be cautious with permissions and trust boundaries when using tools

    ## Troubleshooting

    ### Server Path Issues

    * Double-check the path to your server script is correct
    * Use the absolute path if the relative path isn't working
    * For Windows users, make sure to use forward slashes (/) or escaped backslashes (\\) in the path
    * Make sure that the required runtime is installed (java for Java, npm for Node.js, or uv for Python)
    * Verify the server file has the correct extension (.jar for Java, .js for Node.js or .py for Python)

    Example of correct path usage:

    ```bash
    # Relative path
    java -jar build/libs/client.jar ./server/build/libs/server.jar

    # Absolute path
    java -jar build/libs/client.jar /Users/username/projects/mcp-server/build/libs/server.jar

    # Windows path (either format works)
    java -jar build/libs/client.jar C:/projects/mcp-server/build/libs/server.jar
    java -jar build/libs/client.jar C:\\projects\\mcp-server\\build\\libs\\server.jar
    ```

    ### Response Timing

    * The first response might take up to 30 seconds to return
    * This is normal and happens while:
      * The server initializes
      * Claude processes the query
      * Tools are being executed
    * Subsequent responses are typically faster
    * Don't interrupt the process during this initial waiting period

    ### Common Error Messages

    If you see:

    * `Connection refused`: Ensure the server is running and the path is correct
    * `Tool execution failed`: Verify the tool's required environment variables are set
    * `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not set`: Check your environment variables

    [You can find the complete code for this tutorial here.](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk/tree/main/samples/QuickstartClient)

    ## System Requirements

    Before starting, ensure your system meets these requirements:

    * .NET 8.0 or higher
    * Anthropic API key (Claude)
    * Windows, Linux, or MacOS

    ## Setting up your environment

    First, create a new .NET project:

    ```bash
    dotnet new console -n QuickstartClient
    cd QuickstartClient
    ```

    Then, add the required dependencies to your project:

    ```bash
    dotnet add package ModelContextProtocol --prerelease
    dotnet add package Anthropic.SDK
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting
    ```

    ## Setting up your API key

    You'll need an Anthropic API key from the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).

    ```bash
    dotnet user-secrets init
    dotnet user-secrets set "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" "<your key here>"
    ```

    ## Creating the Client

    ### Basic Client Structure

    First, let's setup the basic client class in the file `Program.cs`:

    ```csharp
    using Anthropic.SDK;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.AI;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
    using ModelContextProtocol.Client;
    using ModelContextProtocol.Protocol.Transport;

    var builder = Host.CreateApplicationBuilder(args);

    builder.Configuration
        .AddEnvironmentVariables()
        .AddUserSecrets<Program>();
    ```

    This creates the beginnings of a .NET console application that can read the API key from user secrets.

    Next, we'll setup the MCP Client:

    ```csharp
    var (command, arguments) = GetCommandAndArguments(args);

    var clientTransport = new StdioClientTransport(new()
    {
        Name = "Demo Server",
        Command = command,
        Arguments = arguments,
    });

    await using var mcpClient = await McpClientFactory.CreateAsync(clientTransport);

    var tools = await mcpClient.ListToolsAsync();
    foreach (var tool in tools)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Connected to server with tools: {tool.Name}");
    }
    ```

    Add this function at the end of the `Program.cs` file:

    ```csharp
    static (string command, string[] arguments) GetCommandAndArguments(string[] args)
    {
        return args switch
        {
            [var script] when script.EndsWith(".py") => ("python", args),
            [var script] when script.EndsWith(".js") => ("node", args),
            [var script] when Directory.Exists(script) || (File.Exists(script) && script.EndsWith(".csproj")) => ("dotnet", ["run", "--project", script, "--no-build"]),
            _ => throw new NotSupportedException("An unsupported server script was provided. Supported scripts are .py, .js, or .csproj")
        };
    }
    ```

    This creates a MCP client that will connect to a server that is provided as a command line argument. It then lists the available tools from the connected server.

    ### Query processing logic

    Now let's add the core functionality for processing queries and handling tool calls:

    ```csharp
    using var anthropicClient = new AnthropicClient(new APIAuthentication(builder.Configuration["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"]))
        .Messages
        .AsBuilder()
        .UseFunctionInvocation()
        .Build();

    var options = new ChatOptions
    {
        MaxOutputTokens = 1000,
        ModelId = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
        Tools = [.. tools]
    };

    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Green;
    Console.WriteLine("MCP Client Started!");
    Console.ResetColor();

    PromptForInput();
    while(Console.ReadLine() is string query && !"exit".Equals(query, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(query))
        {
            PromptForInput();
            continue;
        }

        await foreach (var message in anthropicClient.GetStreamingResponseAsync(query, options))
        {
            Console.Write(message);
        }
        Console.WriteLine();

        PromptForInput();
    }

    static void PromptForInput()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Enter a command (or 'exit' to quit):");
        Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Cyan;
        Console.Write("> ");
        Console.ResetColor();
    }
    ```

    ## Key Components Explained

    ### 1. Client Initialization

    * The client is initialized using `McpClientFactory.CreateAsync()`, which sets up the transport type and command to run the server.

    ### 2. Server Connection

    * Supports Python, Node.js, and .NET servers.
    * The server is started using the command specified in the arguments.
    * Configures to use stdio for communication with the server.
    * Initializes the session and available tools.

    ### 3. Query Processing

    * Leverages [Microsoft.Extensions.AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/ai/ai-extensions) for the chat client.
    * Configures the `IChatClient` to use automatic tool (function) invocation.
    * The client reads user input and sends it to the server.
    * The server processes the query and returns a response.
    * The response is displayed to the user.

    ## Running the Client

    To run your client with any MCP server:

    ```bash
    dotnet run -- path/to/server.csproj # dotnet server
    dotnet run -- path/to/server.py # python server
    dotnet run -- path/to/server.js # node server
    ```

    <Note>
      If you're continuing the weather tutorial from the server quickstart, your command might look something like this: `dotnet run -- path/to/QuickstartWeatherServer`.
    </Note>

    The client will:

    1. Connect to the specified server
    2. List available tools
    3. Start an interactive chat session where you can:
       * Enter queries
       * See tool executions
       * Get responses from Claude
    4. Exit the session when done

    Here's an example of what it should look like it connected to a weather server quickstart:

## Getting started

### Using reference servers

TypeScript-based servers can be used directly with `npx`:

```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

Python-based servers can be used with `uvx` (recommended) or `pip`:

```bash
# Using uvx
uvx mcp-server-git

# Using pip
pip install mcp-server-git
python -m mcp_server_git
```

### Configuring with Claude

To use an MCP server with Claude, add it to your configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/files"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"

# FAQs

> Explaining MCP and why it matters in simple terms

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard way for AI applications and agents to connect to and work with your data sources (e.g. local files, databases, or content repositories) and tools (e.g. GitHub, Google Maps, or Puppeteer).

Think of MCP as a universal adapter for AI applications, similar to what USB-C is for physical devices. USB-C acts as a universal adapter to connect devices to various peripherals and accessories. Similarly, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI applications to different data and tools.

Before USB-C, you needed different cables for different connections. Similarly, before MCP, developers had to build custom connections to each data source or tool they wanted their AI application to work with—a time-consuming process that often resulted in limited functionality. Now, with MCP, developers can easily add connections to their AI applications, making their applications much more powerful from day one.

## Why does MCP matter?

### For AI application users

MCP means your AI applications can access the information and tools you work with every day, making them much more helpful. Rather than AI being limited to what it already knows about, it can now understand your specific documents, data, and work context.

For example, by using MCP servers, applications can access your personal documents from Google Drive or data about your codebase from GitHub, providing more personalized and contextually relevant assistance.

Imagine asking an AI assistant: "Summarize last week's team meeting notes and schedule follow-ups with everyone."

By using connections to data sources powered by MCP, the AI assistant can:

* Connect to your Google Drive through an MCP server to read meeting notes
* Understand who needs follow-ups based on the notes
* Connect to your calendar through another MCP server to schedule the meetings automatically

### For developers

MCP reduces development time and complexity when building AI applications that need to access various data sources. With MCP, developers can focus on building great AI experiences rather than repeatedly creating custom connectors.

Traditionally, connecting applications with data sources required building custom, one-off connections for each data source and each application. This created significant duplicative work—every developer wanting to connect their AI application to Google Drive or Slack needed to build their own connection.

MCP simplifies this by enabling developers to build MCP servers for data sources that are then reusable by various applications. For example, using the open source Google Drive MCP server, many different applications can access data from Google Drive without each developer needing to build a custom connection.

This open source ecosystem of MCP servers means developers can leverage existing work rather than starting from scratch, making it easier to build powerful AI applications that seamlessly integrate with the tools and data sources their users already rely on.

## How does MCP work?

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/mcp-simple-diagram.png" />
</Frame>

MCP creates a bridge between your AI applications and your data through a straightforward system:

* **MCP servers** connect to your data sources and tools (like Google Drive or Slack)
* **MCP clients** are run by AI applications (like Claude Desktop) to connect them to these servers
* When you give permission, your AI application discovers available MCP servers
* The AI model can then use these connections to read information and take actions

This modular system means new capabilities can be added without changing AI applications themselves—just like adding new accessories to your computer without upgrading your entire system.

## Who creates and maintains MCP servers?

MCP servers are developed and maintained by:

* Developers at Anthropic who build servers for common tools and data sources
* Open source contributors who create servers for tools they use
* Enterprise development teams building servers for their internal systems
* Software providers making their applications AI-ready

Once an open source MCP server is created for a data source, it can be used by any MCP-compatible AI application, creating a growing ecosystem of connections. See our [list of example servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/examples), or [get started building your own server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server).



# Building MCP with LLMs

> Speed up your MCP development using LLMs such as Claude!

This guide will help you use LLMs to help you build custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and clients. We'll be focusing on Claude for this tutorial, but you can do this with any frontier LLM.

## Preparing the documentation

Before starting, gather the necessary documentation to help Claude understand MCP:

1. Visit [https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt) and copy the full documentation text
2. Navigate to either the [MCP TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) or [Python SDK repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)
3. Copy the README files and other relevant documentation
4. Paste these documents into your conversation with Claude

## Describing your server

Once you've provided the documentation, clearly describe to Claude what kind of server you want to build. Be specific about:

* What resources your server will expose
* What tools it will provide
* Any prompts it should offer
* What external systems it needs to interact with

For example:

```
Build an MCP server that:
- Connects to my company's PostgreSQL database
- Exposes table schemas as resources
- Provides tools for running read-only SQL queries
- Includes prompts for common data analysis tasks
```

## Working with Claude

When working with Claude on MCP servers:

1. Start with the core functionality first, then iterate to add more features
2. Ask Claude to explain any parts of the code you don't understand
3. Request modifications or improvements as needed
4. Have Claude help you test the server and handle edge cases

Claude can help implement all the key MCP features:

* Resource management and exposure
* Tool definitions and implementations
* Prompt templates and handlers
* Error handling and logging
* Connection and transport setup

## Best practices

When building MCP servers with Claude:

* Break down complex servers into smaller pieces
* Test each component thoroughly before moving on
* Keep security in mind - validate inputs and limit access appropriately
* Document your code well for future maintenance
* Follow MCP protocol specifications carefully

## Next steps

After Claude helps you build your server:

1. Review the generated code carefully
2. Test the server with the MCP Inspector tool
3. Connect it to Claude.app or other MCP clients
4. Iterate based on real usage and feedback

Remember that Claude can help you modify and improve your server as requirements change over time.

Need more guidance? Just ask Claude specific questions about implementing MCP features or troubleshooting issues that arise.



# Debugging

> A comprehensive guide to debugging Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations

Effective debugging is essential when developing MCP servers or integrating them with applications. This guide covers the debugging tools and approaches available in the MCP ecosystem.

<Info>
  This guide is for macOS. Guides for other platforms are coming soon.
</Info>

## Debugging tools overview

MCP provides several tools for debugging at different levels:

1. **MCP Inspector**
   * Interactive debugging interface
   * Direct server testing
   * See the [Inspector guide](/docs/tools/inspector) for details

2. **Claude Desktop Developer Tools**
   * Integration testing
   * Log collection
   * Chrome DevTools integration

3. **Server Logging**
   * Custom logging implementations
   * Error tracking
   * Performance monitoring

## Debugging in Claude Desktop

### Checking server status

The Claude.app interface provides basic server status information:

1. Click the <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/claude-desktop-mcp-plug-icon.svg" style={{display: 'inline', margin: 0, height: '1.3em'}} /> icon to view:
   * Connected servers
   * Available prompts and resources

2. Click the <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/claude-desktop-mcp-hammer-icon.svg" style={{display: 'inline', margin: 0, height: '1.3em'}} /> icon to view:
   * Tools made available to the model

### Viewing logs

Review detailed MCP logs from Claude Desktop:

```bash
# Follow logs in real-time
tail -n 20 -F ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
```

The logs capture:

* Server connection events
* Configuration issues
* Runtime errors
* Message exchanges

### Using Chrome DevTools

Access Chrome's developer tools inside Claude Desktop to investigate client-side errors:

1. Create a `developer_settings.json` file with `allowDevTools` set to true:

```bash
echo '{"allowDevTools": true}' > ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/developer_settings.json
```

2. Open DevTools: `Command-Option-Shift-i`

Note: You'll see two DevTools windows:

* Main content window
* App title bar window

Use the Console panel to inspect client-side errors.

Use the Network panel to inspect:

* Message payloads
* Connection timing

## Common issues

### Working directory

When using MCP servers with Claude Desktop:

* The working directory for servers launched via `claude_desktop_config.json` may be undefined (like `/` on macOS) since Claude Desktop could be started from anywhere
* Always use absolute paths in your configuration and `.env` files to ensure reliable operation
* For testing servers directly via command line, the working directory will be where you run the command

For example in `claude_desktop_config.json`, use:

```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/username/data"]
}
```

Instead of relative paths like `./data`

### Environment variables

MCP servers inherit only a subset of environment variables automatically, like `USER`, `HOME`, and `PATH`.

To override the default variables or provide your own, you can specify an `env` key in `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "myserver": {
    "command": "mcp-server-myapp",
    "env": {
      "MYAPP_API_KEY": "some_key",
    }
  }
}
```

### Server initialization

Common initialization problems:

1. **Path Issues**
   * Incorrect server executable path
   * Missing required files
   * Permission problems
   * Try using an absolute path for `command`

2. **Configuration Errors**
   * Invalid JSON syntax
   * Missing required fields
   * Type mismatches

3. **Environment Problems**
   * Missing environment variables
   * Incorrect variable values
   * Permission restrictions

### Connection problems

When servers fail to connect:

1. Check Claude Desktop logs
2. Verify server process is running
3. Test standalone with [Inspector](/docs/tools/inspector)
4. Verify protocol compatibility

## Implementing logging

### Server-side logging

When building a server that uses the local stdio [transport](/docs/concepts/transports), all messages logged to stderr (standard error) will be captured by the host application (e.g., Claude Desktop) automatically.

<Warning>
  Local MCP servers should not log messages to stdout (standard out), as this will interfere with protocol operation.
</Warning>

For all [transports](/docs/concepts/transports), you can also provide logging to the client by sending a log message notification:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python

# Core architecture

> Understand how MCP connects clients, servers, and LLMs

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is built on a flexible, extensible architecture that enables seamless communication between LLM applications and integrations. This document covers the core architectural components and concepts.

## Overview

MCP follows a client-server architecture where:

* **Hosts** are LLM applications (like Claude Desktop or IDEs) that initiate connections
* **Clients** maintain 1:1 connections with servers, inside the host application
* **Servers** provide context, tools, and prompts to clients

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Host"
        client1[MCP Client]
        client2[MCP Client]
    end
    subgraph "Server Process"
        server1[MCP Server]
    end
    subgraph "Server Process"
        server2[MCP Server]
    end

    client1 <-->|Transport Layer| server1
    client2 <-->|Transport Layer| server2
```

## Core components

### Protocol layer

The protocol layer handles message framing, request/response linking, and high-level communication patterns.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    class Protocol<Request, Notification, Result> {
        // Handle incoming requests
        setRequestHandler<T>(schema: T, handler: (request: T, extra: RequestHandlerExtra) => Promise<Result>): void

        // Handle incoming notifications
        setNotificationHandler<T>(schema: T, handler: (notification: T) => Promise<void>): void

        // Send requests and await responses
        request<T>(request: Request, schema: T, options?: RequestOptions): Promise<T>

        // Send one-way notifications
        notification(notification: Notification): Promise<void>
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    class Session(BaseSession[RequestT, NotificationT, ResultT]):
        async def send_request(
            self,
            request: RequestT,
            result_type: type[Result]
        ) -> Result:
            """Send request and wait for response. Raises McpError if response contains error."""
            # Request handling implementation

        async def send_notification(
            self,
            notification: NotificationT
        ) -> None:
            """Send one-way notification that doesn't expect response."""
            # Notification handling implementation

        async def _received_request(
            self,
            responder: RequestResponder[ReceiveRequestT, ResultT]
        ) -> None:
            """Handle incoming request from other side."""
            # Request handling implementation

        async def _received_notification(
            self,
            notification: ReceiveNotificationT
        ) -> None:
            """Handle incoming notification from other side."""
            # Notification handling implementation
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Key classes include:

* `Protocol`
* `Client`
* `Server`

### Transport layer

The transport layer handles the actual communication between clients and servers. MCP supports multiple transport mechanisms:

1. **Stdio transport**
   * Uses standard input/output for communication
   * Ideal for local processes

2. **HTTP with SSE transport**
   * Uses Server-Sent Events for server-to-client messages
   * HTTP POST for client-to-server messages

All transports use [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) 2.0 to exchange messages. See the [specification](/specification/) for detailed information about the Model Context Protocol message format.

### Message types

MCP has these main types of messages:

1. **Requests** expect a response from the other side:
   ```typescript
   interface Request {
     method: string;
     params?: { ... };
   }
   ```

2. **Results** are successful responses to requests:
   ```typescript
   interface Result {
     [key: string]: unknown;
   }
   ```

3. **Errors** indicate that a request failed:
   ```typescript
   interface Error {
     code: number;
     message: string;
     data?: unknown;
   }
   ```

4. **Notifications** are one-way messages that don't expect a response:
   ```typescript
   interface Notification {
     method: string;
     params?: { ... };
   }
   ```

## Connection lifecycle

### 1. Initialization

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Client->>Server: initialize request
    Server->>Client: initialize response
    Client->>Server: initialized notification

    Note over Client,Server: Connection ready for use
```

1. Client sends `initialize` request with protocol version and capabilities
2. Server responds with its protocol version and capabilities
3. Client sends `initialized` notification as acknowledgment
4. Normal message exchange begins

### 2. Message exchange

After initialization, the following patterns are supported:

* **Request-Response**: Client or server sends requests, the other responds
* **Notifications**: Either party sends one-way messages

### 3. Termination

Either party can terminate the connection:

* Clean shutdown via `close()`
* Transport disconnection
* Error conditions

## Error handling

MCP defines these standard error codes:

```typescript
enum ErrorCode {
  // Standard JSON-RPC error codes
  ParseError = -32700,
  InvalidRequest = -32600,
  MethodNotFound = -32601,
  InvalidParams = -32602,
  InternalError = -32603
}
```

SDKs and applications can define their own error codes above -32000.

Errors are propagated through:

* Error responses to requests
* Error events on transports
* Protocol-level error handlers

## Implementation example

Here's a basic example of implementing an MCP server:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js";
    import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";

    const server = new Server({
      name: "example-server",
      version: "1.0.0"
    }, {
      capabilities: {
        resources: {}
      }
    });

    // Handle requests
    server.setRequestHandler(ListResourcesRequestSchema, async () => {
      return {
        resources: [
          {
            uri: "example://resource",
            name: "Example Resource"
          }
        ]
      };
    });

    // Connect transport
    const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
    await server.connect(transport);
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    import asyncio
    import mcp.types as types
    from mcp.server import Server
    from mcp.server.stdio import stdio_server

    app = Server("example-server")

    @app.list_resources()
    async def list_resources() -> list[types.Resource]:
        return [
            types.Resource(
                uri="example://resource",
                name="Example Resource"
            )
        ]

    async def main():
        async with stdio_server() as streams:
            await app.run(
                streams[0],
                streams[1],
                app.create_initialization_options()
            )

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main())
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best practices

### Transport selection

1. **Local communication**
   * Use stdio transport for local processes
   * Efficient for same-machine communication
   * Simple process management

2. **Remote communication**

   * Load test servers




# Resources

> Expose data and content from your servers to LLMs

Resources are a core primitive in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allow servers to expose data and content that can be read by clients and used as context for LLM interactions.

<Note>
  Resources are designed to be **application-controlled**, meaning that the client application can decide how and when they should be used.
  Different MCP clients may handle resources differently. For example:

  * Claude Desktop currently requires users to explicitly select resources before they can be used
  * Other clients might automatically select resources based on heuristics
  * Some implementations may even allow the AI model itself to determine which resources to use

  Server authors should be prepared to handle any of these interaction patterns when implementing resource support. In order to expose data to models automatically, server authors should use a **model-controlled** primitive such as [Tools](./tools).
</Note>

## Overview

Resources represent any kind of data that an MCP server wants to make available to clients. This can include:

* File contents
* Database records
* API responses
* Live system data
* Screenshots and images
* Log files
* And more

Each resource is identified by a unique URI and can contain either text or binary data.

## Resource URIs

Resources are identified using URIs that follow this format:

```
[protocol]://[host]/[path]
```

For example:

* `file:///home/user/documents/report.pdf`
* `postgres://database/customers/schema`
* `screen://localhost/display1`

The protocol and path structure is defined by the MCP server implementation. Servers can define their own custom URI schemes.

## Resource types

Resources can contain two types of content:

### Text resources

Text resources contain UTF-8 encoded text data. These are suitable for:

* Source code
* Configuration files
* Log files
* JSON/XML data
* Plain text

### Binary resources

Binary resources contain raw binary data encoded in base64. These are suitable for:

* Images
* PDFs
* Audio files
* Video files
* Other non-text formats

## Resource discovery

Clients can discover available resources through two main methods:

### Direct resources

Servers expose a list of concrete resources via the `resources/list` endpoint. Each resource includes:

```typescript
{
  uri: string;           // Unique identifier for the resource
  name: string;          // Human-readable name
  description?: string;  // Optional description
  mimeType?: string;     // Optional MIME type
}
```

### Resource templates

For dynamic resources, servers can expose [URI templates](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6570) that clients can use to construct valid resource URIs:

```typescript
{
  uriTemplate: string;   // URI template following RFC 6570
  name: string;          // Human-readable name for this type
  description?: string;  // Optional description
  mimeType?: string;     // Optional MIME type for all matching resources
}
```

## Reading resources

To read a resource, clients make a `resources/read` request with the resource URI.

The server responds with a list of resource contents:

```typescript
{
  contents: [
    {
      uri: string;        // The URI of the resource
      mimeType?: string;  // Optional MIME type

      // One of:
      text?: string;      // For text resources
      blob?: string;      // For binary resources (base64 encoded)
    }
  ]
}
```

<Tip>
  Servers may return multiple resources in response to one `resources/read` request. This could be used, for example, to return a list of files inside a directory when the directory is read.
</Tip>

## Resource updates

MCP supports real-time updates for resources through two mechanisms:

### List changes

Servers can notify clients when their list of available resources changes via the `notifications/resources/list_changed` notification.

### Content changes

Clients can subscribe to updates for specific resources:

1. Client sends `resources/subscribe` with resource URI
2. Server sends `notifications/resources/updated` when the resource changes
3. Client can fetch latest content with `resources/read`
4. Client can unsubscribe with `resources/unsubscribe`

## Example implementation

Here's a simple example of implementing resource support in an MCP server:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    const server = new Server({
      name: "example-server",
      version: "1.0.0"
    }, {
      capabilities: {
        resources: {}
      }
    });

    // List available resources
    server.setRequestHandler(ListResourcesRequestSchema, async () => {
      return {
        resources: [
          {
            uri: "file:///logs/app.log",
            name: "Application Logs",
            mimeType: "text/plain"
          }
        ]
      };
    });

    // Read resource contents
    server.setRequestHandler(ReadResourceRequestSchema, async (request) => {
      const uri = request.params.uri;

      if (uri === "file:///logs/app.log") {
        const logContents = await readLogFile();
        return {
          contents: [
            {
              uri,
              mimeType: "text/plain",
              text: logContents
            }
          ]
        };
      }

      throw new Error("Resource not found");
    });
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    app = Server("example-server")

    @app.list_resources()
    async def list_resources() -> list[types.Resource]:
        return [
            types.Resource(
                uri="file:///logs/app.log",
                name="Application Logs",
                mimeType="text/plain"
            )
        ]

    @app.read_resource()
    async def read_resource(uri: AnyUrl) -> str:
        if str(uri) == "file:///logs/app.log":
            log_contents = await read_log_file()
            return log_contents

        raise ValueError("Resource not found")

    # Start server
    async with stdio_server() as streams:
        await app.run(
            streams[0],
            streams[1],
            app.create_initialization_options()
        )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best practices

When implementing resource support:

1. Use clear, descriptive resource names and URIs
2. Include helpful descriptions to guide LLM understanding
3. Set appropriate MIME types when known
4. Implement resource templates for dynamic content
5. Use subscriptions for frequently changing resources
6. Handle errors gracefully with clear error messages
7. Consider pagination for large resource lists
8. Cache resource contents when appropriate
9. Validate URIs before processing
10. Document your custom URI schemes

## Security considerations

When exposing resources:

* Validate all resource URIs
* Implement appropriate access controls
* Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal
* Be cautious with binary data handling
* Consider rate limiting for resource reads
* Audit resource access
* Encrypt sensitive data in transit
* Validate MIME types
* Implement timeouts for long-running reads
* Handle resource cleanup appropriately




# Prompts

> Create reusable prompt templates and workflows

Prompts enable servers to define reusable prompt templates and workflows that clients can easily surface to users and LLMs. They provide a powerful way to standardize and share common LLM interactions.

<Note>
  Prompts are designed to be **user-controlled**, meaning they are exposed from servers to clients with the intention of the user being able to explicitly select them for use.
</Note>

## Overview

Prompts in MCP are predefined templates that can:

* Accept dynamic arguments
* Include context from resources
* Chain multiple interactions
* Guide specific workflows
* Surface as UI elements (like slash commands)

## Prompt structure

Each prompt is defined with:

```typescript
{
  name: string;              // Unique identifier for the prompt
  description?: string;      // Human-readable description
  arguments?: [              // Optional list of arguments
    {
      name: string;          // Argument identifier
      description?: string;  // Argument description
      required?: boolean;    // Whether argument is required
    }
  ]
}
```

## Discovering prompts

Clients can discover available prompts through the `prompts/list` endpoint:

```typescript
// Request
{
  method: "prompts/list"
}

// Response
{
  prompts: [
    {
      name: "analyze-code",
      description: "Analyze code for potential improvements",
      arguments: [
        {
          name: "language",
          description: "Programming language",
          required: true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Using prompts

To use a prompt, clients make a `prompts/get` request:

````typescript
// Request
{
  method: "prompts/get",
  params: {
    name: "analyze-code",
    arguments: {
      language: "python"
    }
  }
}

// Response
{
  description: "Analyze Python code for potential improvements",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: {
        type: "text",
        text: "Please analyze the following Python code for potential improvements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_sum(numbers):\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        total = total + num\n    return total\n\nresult = calculate_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nprint(result)\n```"
      }
    }
  ]
}
````

## Dynamic prompts

Prompts can be dynamic and include:

### Embedded resource context

```json
{
  "name": "analyze-project",
  "description": "Analyze project logs and code",
  "arguments": [
    {
      "name": "timeframe",
      "description": "Time period to analyze logs",
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "name": "fileUri",
      "description": "URI of code file to review",
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
```

When handling the `prompts/get` request:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Analyze these system logs and the code file for any issues:"

```typescript
const debugWorkflow = {

  async getMessages(error: string) {
    return [
      {

## Best practices

When implementing prompts:

1. Use clear, descriptive prompt names
2. Provide detailed descriptions for prompts and arguments
3. Validate all required arguments
4. Handle missing arguments gracefully
5. Consider versioning for prompt templates
6. Cache dynamic content when appropriate
7. Implement error handling
8. Document expected argument formats
9. Consider prompt composability
10. Test prompts with various inputs

## UI integration

Prompts can be surfaced in client UIs as:

* Slash commands
* Quick actions
* Context menu items
* Command palette entries
* Guided workflows
* Interactive forms

## Updates and changes

Servers can notify clients about prompt changes:

1. Server capability: `prompts.listChanged`
2. Notification: `notifications/prompts/list_changed`
3. Client re-fetches prompt list

## Security considerations

When implementing prompts:

* Validate all arguments
* Sanitize user input
* Consider rate limiting
* Implement access controls
* Audit prompt usage
* Handle sensitive data appropriately
* Validate generated content
* Implement timeouts
* Consider prompt injection risks
* Document security requirements





# Tools

> Enable LLMs to perform actions through your server

Tools are a powerful primitive in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enable servers to expose executable functionality to clients. Through tools, LLMs can interact with external systems, perform computations, and take actions in the real world.

<Note>
  Tools are designed to be **model-controlled**, meaning that tools are exposed from servers to clients with the intention of the AI model being able to automatically invoke them (with a human in the loop to grant approval).
</Note>

## Overview

Tools in MCP allow servers to expose executable functions that can be invoked by clients and used by LLMs to perform actions. Key aspects of tools include:

* **Discovery**: Clients can list available tools through the `tools/list` endpoint
* **Invocation**: Tools are called using the `tools/call` endpoint, where servers perform the requested operation and return results
* **Flexibility**: Tools can range from simple calculations to complex API interactions

Like [resources](/docs/concepts/resources), tools are identified by unique names and can include descriptions to guide their usage. However, unlike resources, tools represent dynamic operations that can modify state or interact with external systems.

## Tool definition structure

Each tool is defined with the following structure:

```typescript
{
  name: string;          // Unique identifier for the tool
  description?: string;  // Human-readable description
  inputSchema: {         // JSON Schema for the tool's parameters
    type: "object",
    properties: { ... }  // Tool-specific parameters
  },
  annotations?: {        // Optional hints about tool behavior
    title?: string;      // Human-readable title for the tool
    readOnlyHint?: boolean;    // If true, the tool does not modify its environment
    destructiveHint?: boolean; // If true, the tool may perform destructive updates
    idempotentHint?: boolean;  // If true, repeated calls with same args have no additional effect
    openWorldHint?: boolean;   // If true, tool interacts with external entities
  }
}
```

## Implementing tools

Here's an example of implementing a basic tool in an MCP server:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    const server = new Server({
      name: "example-server",
      version: "1.0.0"
    }, {
      capabilities: {
        tools: {}
      }
    });

    // Define available tools
    server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async () => {
      return {
        tools: [{
          name: "calculate_sum",
          description: "Add two numbers together",
          inputSchema: {
            type: "object",
            properties: {
              a: { type: "number" },
              b: { type: "number" }
            },
            required: ["a", "b"]
          }
        }]
      };
    });

    // Handle tool execution
    server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, async (request) => {
      if (request.params.name === "calculate_sum") {
        const { a, b } = request.params.arguments;
        return {
          content: [
            {
              type: "text",
              text: String(a + b)
            }
          ]
        };
      }
      throw new Error("Tool not found");
    });
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    app = Server("example-server")

    @app.list_tools()
    async def list_tools() -> list[types.Tool]:
        return [
            types.Tool(
                name="calculate_sum",
                description="Add two numbers together",
                inputSchema={
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "a": {"type": "number"},
                        "b": {"type": "number"}
                    },
                    "required": ["a", "b"]
                }
            )

    @app.call_tool()
    async def call_tool(
        name: str,
        arguments: dict

        if name == "calculate_sum":
            a = arguments["a"]
            b = arguments["b"]
            result = a + b
            return [types.TextContent(type="text", text=str(result))]
        raise ValueError(f"Tool not found: {name}")
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Example tool patterns

Here are some examples of types of tools that a server could provide:

### System operations

Tools that interact with the local system:

```typescript
{
  name: "execute_command",
  description: "Run a shell command",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      command: { type: "string" },
      args: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } }
    }
  }
}
```

### API integrations

Tools that wrap external APIs:

```typescript
{
  name: "github_create_issue",
  description: "Create a GitHub issue",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      title: { type: "string" },
      body: { type: "string" },
      labels: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } }
    }
  }
}
```

### Data processing

Tools that transform or analyze data:

```typescript
{
  name: "analyze_csv",
  description: "Analyze a CSV file",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      filepath: { type: "string" },
      operations: {
        type: "array",
        items: {
          enum: ["sum", "average", "count"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Best practices

When implementing tools:

1. Provide clear, descriptive names and descriptions
2. Use detailed JSON Schema definitions for parameters
3. Include examples in tool descriptions to demonstrate how the model should use them
4. Implement proper error handling and validation
5. Use progress reporting for long operations
6. Keep tool operations focused and atomic
7. Document expected return value structures
8. Implement proper timeouts
9. Consider rate limiting for resource-intensive operations
10. Log tool usage for debugging and monitoring

## Security considerations

When exposing tools:

### Input validation

* Validate all parameters against the schema
* Sanitize file paths and system commands
* Validate URLs and external identifiers
* Check parameter sizes and ranges
* Prevent command injection

### Access control

* Implement authentication where needed
* Use appropriate authorization checks
* Audit tool usage
* Rate limit requests
* Monitor for abuse

### Error handling

* Don't expose internal errors to clients
* Log security-relevant errors
* Handle timeouts appropriately
* Clean up resources after errors
* Validate return values

## Tool discovery and updates

MCP supports dynamic tool discovery:

1. Clients can list available tools at any time
2. Servers can notify clients when tools change using `notifications/tools/list_changed`
3. Tools can be added or removed during runtime
4. Tool definitions can be updated (though this should be done carefully)

## Error handling

Tool errors should be reported within the result object, not as MCP protocol-level errors. This allows the LLM to see and potentially handle the error. When a tool encounters an error:

1. Set `isError` to `true` in the result
2. Include error details in the `content` array

Here's an example of proper error handling for tools:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    try {
      // Tool operation
      const result = performOperation();
      return {
        content: [
          {
            type: "text",
            text: `Operation successful: ${result}`
          }
        ]
      };
    } catch (error) {
      return {
        isError: true,
        content: [
          {
            type: "text",
            text: `Error: ${error.message}`
          }
        ]
      };
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    try:
        # Tool operation
        result = perform_operation()
        return types.CallToolResult(
            content=[
                types.TextContent(
                    type="text",
                    text=f"Operation successful: {result}"
                )
            ]
        )
    except Exception as error:
        return types.CallToolResult(
            isError=True,
            content=[
                types.TextContent(
                    type="text",
                    text=f"Error: {str(error)}"
                )
            ]
        )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This approach allows the LLM to see that an error occurred and potentially take corrective action or request human intervention.

## Tool annotations

Tool annotations provide additional metadata about a tool's behavior, helping clients understand how to present and manage tools. These annotations are hints that describe the nature and impact of a tool, but should not be relied upon for security decisions.

### Purpose of tool annotations

Tool annotations serve several key purposes:

1. Provide UX-specific information without affecting model context
2. Help clients categorize and present tools appropriately
3. Convey information about a tool's potential side effects
4. Assist in developing intuitive interfaces for tool approval

### Available tool annotations

The MCP specification defines the following annotations for tools:

| Annotation        | Type    | Default | Description                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `title`           | string  | -       | A human-readable title for the tool, useful for UI display                                                                           |
| `readOnlyHint`    | boolean | false   | If true, indicates the tool does not modify its environment                                                                          |
| `destructiveHint` | boolean | true    | If true, the tool may perform destructive updates (only meaningful when `readOnlyHint` is false)                                     |
| `idempotentHint`  | boolean | false   | If true, calling the tool repeatedly with the same arguments has no additional effect (only meaningful when `readOnlyHint` is false) |
| `openWorldHint`   | boolean | true    | If true, the tool may interact with an "open world" of external entities                                                             |

### Example usage

Here's how to define tools with annotations for different scenarios:

```typescript
// A read-only search tool
{
  name: "web_search",
  description: "Search the web for information",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      query: { type: "string" }
    },
    required: ["query"]
  },
  annotations: {
    title: "Web Search",
    readOnlyHint: true,
    openWorldHint: true
  }
}

// A destructive file deletion tool
{
  name: "delete_file",
  description: "Delete a file from the filesystem",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      path: { type: "string" }
    },
    required: ["path"]
  },
  annotations: {
    title: "Delete File",
    readOnlyHint: false,
    destructiveHint: true,
    idempotentHint: true,
    openWorldHint: false
  }
}

// A non-destructive database record creation tool
{
  name: "create_record",
  description: "Create a new record in the database",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      table: { type: "string" },
      data: { type: "object" }
    },
    required: ["table", "data"]
  },
  annotations: {
    title: "Create Database Record",
    readOnlyHint: false,
    destructiveHint: false,
    idempotentHint: false,
    openWorldHint: false
  }
}
```

### Best practices for tool annotations

1. **Be accurate about side effects**: Clearly indicate whether a tool modifies its environment and whether those modifications are destructive.

2. **Use descriptive titles**: Provide human-friendly titles that clearly describe the tool's purpose.

3. **Indicate idempotency properly**: Mark tools as idempotent only if repeated calls with the same arguments truly have no additional effect.

4. **Set appropriate open/closed world hints**: Indicate whether a tool interacts with a closed system (like a database) or an open system (like the web).

5. **Remember annotations are hints**: All properties in ToolAnnotations are hints and not guaranteed to provide a faithful description of tool behavior. Clients should never make security-critical decisions based solely on annotations.

## Testing tools

A comprehensive testing strategy for MCP tools should cover:

* **Functional testing**: Verify tools execute correctly with valid inputs and handle invalid inputs appropriately
* **Integration testing**: Test tool interaction with external systems using both real and mocked dependencies
* **Security testing**: Validate authentication, authorization, input sanitization, and rate limiting
* **Performance testing**: Check behavior under load, timeout handling, and resource cleanup
* **Error handling**: Ensure tools properly report errors through the MCP protocol and clean up resources



# Sampling

> Let your servers request completions from LLMs

Sampling is a powerful MCP feature that allows servers to request LLM completions through the client, enabling sophisticated agentic behaviors while maintaining security and privacy.

<Info>
  This feature of MCP is not yet supported in the Claude Desktop client.
</Info>

## How sampling works

The sampling flow follows these steps:

1. Server sends a `sampling/createMessage` request to the client
2. Client reviews the request and can modify it
3. Client samples from an LLM
4. Client reviews the completion
5. Client returns the result to the server

This human-in-the-loop design ensures users maintain control over what the LLM sees and generates.

## Message format

Sampling requests use a standardized message format:

```typescript
{
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user" | "assistant",
      content: {
        type: "text" | "image",

        // For text:
        text?: string,

        // For images:
        data?: string,             // base64 encoded
        mimeType?: string
      }
    }
  ],
  modelPreferences?: {
    hints?: [{
      name?: string                // Suggested model name/family
    }],
    costPriority?: number,         // 0-1, importance of minimizing cost
    speedPriority?: number,        // 0-1, importance of low latency
    intelligencePriority?: number  // 0-1, importance of capabilities
  },
  systemPrompt?: string,
  includeContext?: "none" | "thisServer" | "allServers",
  temperature?: number,
  maxTokens: number,
  stopSequences?: string[],
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>
}
```

## Request parameters

### Messages

The `messages` array contains the conversation history to send to the LLM. Each message has:

* `role`: Either "user" or "assistant"
* `content`: The message content, which can be:
  * Text content with a `text` field
  * Image content with `data` (base64) and `mimeType` fields

### Model preferences

The `modelPreferences` object allows servers to specify their model selection preferences:

* `hints`: Array of model name suggestions that clients can use to select an appropriate model:
  * `name`: String that can match full or partial model names (e.g. "claude-3", "sonnet")
  * Clients may map hints to equivalent models from different providers
  * Multiple hints are evaluated in preference order

* Priority values (0-1 normalized):
  * `costPriority`: Importance of minimizing costs
  * `speedPriority`: Importance of low latency response
  * `intelligencePriority`: Importance of advanced model capabilities

Clients make the final model selection based on these preferences and their available models.

### System prompt

An optional `systemPrompt` field allows servers to request a specific system prompt. The client may modify or ignore this.

### Context inclusion

The `includeContext` parameter specifies what MCP context to include:

* `"none"`: No additional context
* `"thisServer"`: Include context from the requesting server
* `"allServers"`: Include context from all connected MCP servers

The client controls what context is actually included.

### Sampling parameters

Fine-tune the LLM sampling with:

* `temperature`: Controls randomness (0.0 to 1.0)
* `maxTokens`: Maximum tokens to generate
* `stopSequences`: Array of sequences that stop generation
* `metadata`: Additional provider-specific parameters

## Response format

The client returns a completion result:

```typescript
{
  model: string,  // Name of the model used
  stopReason?: "endTurn" | "stopSequence" | "maxTokens" | string,
  role: "user" | "assistant",
  content: {
    type: "text" | "image",
    text?: string,
    data?: string,
    mimeType?: string
  }
}
```

## Example request

Here's an example of requesting sampling from a client:

```json
{
  "method": "sampling/createMessage",
  "params": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "What files are in the current directory?"
        }
      }
    ],
    "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful file system assistant.",
    "includeContext": "thisServer",
    "maxTokens": 100
  }
}
```

## Best practices

When implementing sampling:

1. Always provide clear, well-structured prompts
2. Handle both text and image content appropriately
3. Set reasonable token limits
4. Include relevant context through `includeContext`
5. Validate responses before using them
6. Handle errors gracefully
7. Consider rate limiting sampling requests
8. Document expected sampling behavior
9. Test with various model parameters
10. Monitor sampling costs

## Human in the loop controls

Sampling is designed with human oversight in mind:

### For prompts

* Clients should show users the proposed prompt
* Users should be able to modify or reject prompts
* System prompts can be filtered or modified
* Context inclusion is controlled by the client

### For completions

* Clients should show users the completion
* Users should be able to modify or reject completions
* Clients can filter or modify completions
* Users control which model is used

## Security considerations

When implementing sampling:

* Validate all message content
* Sanitize sensitive information
* Implement appropriate rate limits
* Monitor sampling usage
* Encrypt data in transit
* Handle user data privacy
* Audit sampling requests
* Control cost exposure
* Implement timeouts
* Handle model errors gracefully

## Common patterns

### Agentic workflows

Sampling enables agentic patterns like:

* Reading and analyzing resources
* Making decisions based on context
* Generating structured data
* Handling multi-step tasks
* Providing interactive assistance

### Context management

Best practices for context:

* Request minimal necessary context
* Structure context clearly
* Handle context size limits
* Update context as needed
* Clean up stale context

### Error handling

Robust error handling should:

* Catch sampling failures
* Handle timeout errors
* Manage rate limits
* Validate responses
* Provide fallback behaviors
* Log errors appropriately

## Limitations

Be aware of these limitations:

* Sampling depends on client capabilities
* Users control sampling behavior
* Context size has limits
* Rate limits may apply
* Costs should be considered
* Model availability varies
* Response times vary
* Not all content types supported



# Roots

> Understanding roots in MCP

Roots are a concept in MCP that define the boundaries where servers can operate. They provide a way for clients to inform servers about relevant resources and their locations.

## What are Roots?

A root is a URI that a client suggests a server should focus on. When a client connects to a server, it declares which roots the server should work with. While primarily used for filesystem paths, roots can be any valid URI including HTTP URLs.

For example, roots could be:

```
file:///home/user/projects/myapp
https://api.example.com/v1
```

## Why Use Roots?

Roots serve several important purposes:

1. **Guidance**: They inform servers about relevant resources and locations
2. **Clarity**: Roots make it clear which resources are part of your workspace
3. **Organization**: Multiple roots let you work with different resources simultaneously

## How Roots Work

When a client supports roots, it:

1. Declares the `roots` capability during connection
2. Provides a list of suggested roots to the server
3. Notifies the server when roots change (if supported)

While roots are informational and not strictly enforcing, servers should:

1. Respect the provided roots
2. Use root URIs to locate and access resources
3. Prioritize operations within root boundaries

## Common Use Cases

Roots are commonly used to define:

* Project directories
* Repository locations
* API endpoints
* Configuration locations
* Resource boundaries

## Best Practices

When working with roots:

1. Only suggest necessary resources
2. Use clear, descriptive names for roots
3. Monitor root accessibility
4. Handle root changes gracefully

## Example

Here's how a typical MCP client might expose roots:

```json
{
  "roots": [
    {
      "uri": "file:///home/user/projects/frontend",
      "name": "Frontend Repository"
    },
    {
      "uri": "https://api.example.com/v1",
      "name": "API Endpoint"
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration suggests the server focus on both a local repository and an API endpoint while keeping them logically separated.



# Transports

> Learn about MCP's communication mechanisms

Transports in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) provide the foundation for communication between clients and servers. A transport handles the underlying mechanics of how messages are sent and received.

## Message Format

MCP uses [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) 2.0 as its wire format. The transport layer is responsible for converting MCP protocol messages into JSON-RPC format for transmission and converting received JSON-RPC messages back into MCP protocol messages.

There are three types of JSON-RPC messages used:

### Requests

```typescript
{
  jsonrpc: "2.0",
  id: number | string,
  method: string,
  params?: object
}
```

### Responses

```typescript
{
  jsonrpc: "2.0",
  id: number | string,
  result?: object,
  error?: {
    code: number,
    message: string,
    data?: unknown
  }
}
```

### Notifications

```typescript
{
  jsonrpc: "2.0",
  method: string,
  params?: object
}
```

## Built-in Transport Types

MCP includes two standard transport implementations:

### Standard Input/Output (stdio)

The stdio transport enables communication through standard input and output streams. This is particularly useful for local integrations and command-line tools.

Use stdio when:

* Building command-line tools
* Implementing local integrations
* Needing simple process communication
* Working with shell scripts

        async with ClientSession(streams[0], streams[1]) as session:
            await session.initialize()
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)

SSE transport enables server-to-client streaming with HTTP POST requests for client-to-server communication.

Use SSE when:

* Only server-to-client streaming is needed
* Working with restricted networks
* Implementing simple updates

#### Security Warning: DNS Rebinding Attacks

SSE transports can be vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks if not properly secured. To prevent this:

1. **Always validate Origin headers** on incoming SSE connections to ensure they come from expected sources
2. **Avoid binding servers to all network interfaces** (0.0.0.0) when running locally - bind only to localhost (127.0.0.1) instead
3. **Implement proper authentication** for all SSE connections

Without these protections, attackers could use DNS rebinding to interact with local MCP servers from remote websites.

## Custom Transports

MCP makes it easy to implement custom transports for specific needs. Any transport implementation just needs to conform to the Transport interface:

You can implement custom transports for:

* Custom network protocols
* Specialized communication channels
* Integration with existing systems
* Performance optimization

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    interface Transport {
      // Start processing messages
      start(): Promise<void>;

      // Send a JSON-RPC message
      send(message: JSONRPCMessage): Promise<void>;

      // Close the connection
      close(): Promise<void>;

      // Callbacks
      onclose?: () => void;
      onerror?: (error: Error) => void;

## Error Handling

Transport implementations should handle various error scenarios:

1. Connection errors
2. Message parsing errors
3. Protocol errors
4. Network timeouts
5. Resource cleanup

Example error handling:

          this.onerror?.(new Error(`Failed to connect: ${error}`));
          throw error;
        }
      }

      async send(message: JSONRPCMessage) {
        try {
          // Sending logic
        } catch (error) {
          this.onerror?.(new Error(`Failed to send message: ${error}`));

## Best Practices

When implementing or using MCP transport:

1. Handle connection lifecycle properly
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Clean up resources on connection close
4. Use appropriate timeouts
5. Validate messages before sending
6. Log transport events for debugging
7. Implement reconnection logic when appropriate
8. Handle backpressure in message queues
9. Monitor connection health
10. Implement proper security measures

## Security Considerations

When implementing transport:

### Authentication and Authorization

* Implement proper authentication mechanisms
* Validate client credentials
* Use secure token handling
* Implement authorization checks

### Data Security

* Use TLS for network transport
* Encrypt sensitive data
* Validate message integrity
* Implement message size limits
* Sanitize input data

### Network Security

* Implement rate limiting
* Use appropriate timeouts
* Handle denial of service scenarios
* Monitor for unusual patterns
* Implement proper firewall rules
* For SSE transports, validate Origin headers to prevent DNS rebinding attacks
* For local SSE servers, bind only to localhost (127.0.0.1) instead of all interfaces (0.0.0.0)

## Debugging Transport

Tips for debugging transport issues:

1. Enable debug logging
2. Monitor message flow
3. Check connection states
4. Validate message formats
5. Test error scenarios
6. Use network analysis tools
7. Implement health checks
8. Monitor resource usage
9. Test edge cases
10. Use proper error tracking

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol allows applications to provide context for LLMs in a standardized way, separating the concerns of providing context from the actual LLM interaction. This Python SDK implements the full MCP specification, making it easy to:

- Build MCP clients that can connect to any MCP server
- Create MCP servers that expose resources, prompts and tools
- Use standard transports like stdio and SSE
- Handle all MCP protocol messages and lifecycle events

## Installation

### Adding MCP to your python project

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage your Python projects. 

If you haven't created a uv-managed project yet, create one:

   ```bash
   uv init mcp-server-demo
   cd mcp-server-demo
   ```

   Then add MCP to your project dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv add "mcp[cli]"
   ```

Alternatively, for projects using pip for dependencies:
```bash
pip install "mcp[cli]"
```

### Running the standalone MCP development tools

To run the mcp command with uv:

```bash
uv run mcp
```

## Quickstart

Let's create a simple MCP server that exposes a calculator tool and some data:

```python
# server.py
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create an MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("Demo")


# Add an addition tool
@mcp.tool()
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers"""
    return a + b


# Add a dynamic greeting resource
@mcp.resource("greeting://{name}")
def get_greeting(name: str) -> str:
    """Get a personalized greeting"""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

You can install this server in [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) and interact with it right away by running:
```bash
mcp install server.py
```

Alternatively, you can test it with the MCP Inspector:
```bash
mcp dev server.py
```

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. Think of it like a web API, but specifically designed for LLM interactions. MCP servers can:

- Expose data through **Resources** (think of these sort of like GET endpoints; they are used to load information into the LLM's context)
- Provide functionality through **Tools** (sort of like POST endpoints; they are used to execute code or otherwise produce a side effect)
- Define interaction patterns through **Prompts** (reusable templates for LLM interactions)
- And more!

## Core Concepts

### Server

The FastMCP server is your core interface to the MCP protocol. It handles connection management, protocol compliance, and message routing:

```python
# Add lifespan support for startup/shutdown with strong typing
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from collections.abc import AsyncIterator
from dataclasses import dataclass

from fake_database import Database  # Replace with your actual DB type

from mcp.server.fastmcp import Context, FastMCP

# Create a named server
mcp = FastMCP("My App")

# Specify dependencies for deployment and development
mcp = FastMCP("My App", dependencies=["pandas", "numpy"])


@dataclass
class AppContext:
    db: Database


@asynccontextmanager
async def app_lifespan(server: FastMCP) -> AsyncIterator[AppContext]:
    """Manage application lifecycle with type-safe context"""
    # Initialize on startup
    db = await Database.connect()
    try:
        yield AppContext(db=db)
    finally:
        # Cleanup on shutdown
        await db.disconnect()


# Pass lifespan to server
mcp = FastMCP("My App", lifespan=app_lifespan)


# Access type-safe lifespan context in tools
@mcp.tool()
def query_db(ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Tool that uses initialized resources"""
    db = ctx.request_context.lifespan_context.db
    return db.query()
```

### Resources

Resources are how you expose data to LLMs. They're similar to GET endpoints in a REST API - they provide data but shouldn't perform significant computation or have side effects:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My App")


@mcp.resource("config://app")
def get_config() -> str:
    """Static configuration data"""
    return "App configuration here"


@mcp.resource("users://{user_id}/profile")
def get_user_profile(user_id: str) -> str:
    """Dynamic user data"""
    return f"Profile data for user {user_id}"
```

### Tools

Tools let LLMs take actions through your server. Unlike resources, tools are expected to perform computation and have side effects:

```python
import httpx
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My App")


@mcp.tool()
def calculate_bmi(weight_kg: float, height_m: float) -> float:
    """Calculate BMI given weight in kg and height in meters"""
    return weight_kg / (height_m**2)


@mcp.tool()
async def fetch_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Fetch current weather for a city"""
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(f"https://api.weather.com/{city}")
        return response.text
```

### Prompts

Prompts are reusable templates that help LLMs interact with your server effectively:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from mcp.server.fastmcp.prompts import base

mcp = FastMCP("My App")


@mcp.prompt()
def review_code(code: str) -> str:
    return f"Please review this code:\n\n{code}"


@mcp.prompt()
def debug_error(error: str) -> list[base.Message]:
    return [
        base.UserMessage("I'm seeing this error:"),
        base.UserMessage(error),
        base.AssistantMessage("I'll help debug that. What have you tried so far?"),
    ]
```

### Images

FastMCP provides an `Image` class that automatically handles image data:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP, Image
from PIL import Image as PILImage

mcp = FastMCP("My App")


@mcp.tool()
def create_thumbnail(image_path: str) -> Image:
    """Create a thumbnail from an image"""
    img = PILImage.open(image_path)
    img.thumbnail((100, 100))
    return Image(data=img.tobytes(), format="png")
```

### Context

The Context object gives your tools and resources access to MCP capabilities:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP, Context

mcp = FastMCP("My App")


@mcp.tool()
async def long_task(files: list[str], ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Process multiple files with progress tracking"""
    for i, file in enumerate(files):
        ctx.info(f"Processing {file}")
        await ctx.report_progress(i, len(files))
        data, mime_type = await ctx.read_resource(f"file://{file}")
    return "Processing complete"
```

### Authentication

Authentication can be used by servers that want to expose tools accessing protected resources.

`mcp.server.auth` implements an OAuth 2.0 server interface, which servers can use by
providing an implementation of the `OAuthServerProvider` protocol.

```
mcp = FastMCP("My App",
        auth_provider=MyOAuthServerProvider(),
        auth=AuthSettings(
            issuer_url="https://myapp.com",
            revocation_options=RevocationOptions(
                enabled=True,
            ),
            client_registration_options=ClientRegistrationOptions(
                enabled=True,
                valid_scopes=["myscope", "myotherscope"],
                default_scopes=["myscope"],
            ),
            required_scopes=["myscope"],
        ),
)
```

See [OAuthServerProvider](mcp/server/auth/provider.py) for more details.

## Running Your Server

### Development Mode

The fastest way to test and debug your server is with the MCP Inspector:

```bash
mcp dev server.py

# Add dependencies
mcp dev server.py --with pandas --with numpy

# Mount local code
mcp dev server.py --with-editable .
```

### Claude Desktop Integration

Once your server is ready, install it in Claude Desktop:

```bash
mcp install server.py

# Custom name
mcp install server.py --name "My Analytics Server"

# Environment variables
mcp install server.py -v API_KEY=abc123 -v DB_URL=postgres://...
mcp install server.py -f .env
```

### Direct Execution

For advanced scenarios like custom deployments:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My App")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

Run it with:
```bash
python server.py
# or
mcp run server.py
```

### Mounting to an Existing ASGI Server

You can mount the SSE server to an existing ASGI server using the `sse_app` method. This allows you to integrate the SSE server with other ASGI applications.

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Mount, Host
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP


mcp = FastMCP("My App")

# Mount the SSE server to the existing ASGI server
app = Starlette(
    routes=[
        Mount('/', app=mcp.sse_app()),
    ]
)

# or dynamically mount as host
app.router.routes.append(Host('mcp.acme.corp', app=mcp.sse_app()))
```

For more information on mounting applications in Starlette, see the [Starlette documentation](https://www.starlette.io/routing/#submounting-routes).

## Examples

### Echo Server

A simple server demonstrating resources, tools, and prompts:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Echo")


@mcp.resource("echo://{message}")
def echo_resource(message: str) -> str:
    """Echo a message as a resource"""
    return f"Resource echo: {message}"


@mcp.tool()
def echo_tool(message: str) -> str:
    """Echo a message as a tool"""
    return f"Tool echo: {message}"


@mcp.prompt()
def echo_prompt(message: str) -> str:
    """Create an echo prompt"""
    return f"Please process this message: {message}"
```

### SQLite Explorer

A more complex example showing database integration:

```python
import sqlite3

from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("SQLite Explorer")


@mcp.resource("schema://main")
def get_schema() -> str:
    """Provide the database schema as a resource"""
    conn = sqlite3.connect("database.db")
    schema = conn.execute("SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'").fetchall()
    return "\n".join(sql[0] for sql in schema if sql[0])


@mcp.tool()
def query_data(sql: str) -> str:
    """Execute SQL queries safely"""
    conn = sqlite3.connect("database.db")
    try:
        result = conn.execute(sql).fetchall()
        return "\n".join(str(row) for row in result)
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"
```

## Advanced Usage

### Low-Level Server

For more control, you can use the low-level server implementation directly. This gives you full access to the protocol and allows you to customize every aspect of your server, including lifecycle management through the lifespan API:

```python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from collections.abc import AsyncIterator

from fake_database import Database  # Replace with your actual DB type

from mcp.server import Server


@asynccontextmanager
async def server_lifespan(server: Server) -> AsyncIterator[dict]:
    """Manage server startup and shutdown lifecycle."""
    # Initialize resources on startup
    db = await Database.connect()
    try:
        yield {"db": db}
    finally:
        # Clean up on shutdown
        await db.disconnect()


# Pass lifespan to server
server = Server("example-server", lifespan=server_lifespan)


# Access lifespan context in handlers
@server.call_tool()
async def query_db(name: str, arguments: dict) -> list:
    ctx = server.request_context
    db = ctx.lifespan_context["db"]
    return await db.query(arguments["query"])
```

The lifespan API provides:
- A way to initialize resources when the server starts and clean them up when it stops
- Access to initialized resources through the request context in handlers
- Type-safe context passing between lifespan and request handlers

```python
import mcp.server.stdio
import mcp.types as types
from mcp.server.lowlevel import NotificationOptions, Server
from mcp.server.models import InitializationOptions

# Create a server instance
server = Server("example-server")


@server.list_prompts()
async def handle_list_prompts() -> list[types.Prompt]:
    return [
        types.Prompt(
            name="example-prompt",
            description="An example prompt template",
            arguments=[
                types.PromptArgument(
                    name="arg1", description="Example argument", required=True
                )
            ],
        )
    ]


@server.get_prompt()
async def handle_get_prompt(
    name: str, arguments: dict[str, str] | None
) -> types.GetPromptResult:
    if name != "example-prompt":
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown prompt: {name}")

    return types.GetPromptResult(
        description="Example prompt",
        messages=[
            types.PromptMessage(
                role="user",
                content=types.TextContent(type="text", text="Example prompt text"),
            )
        ],
    )


async def run():
    async with mcp.server.stdio.stdio_server() as (read_stream, write_stream):
        await server.run(
            read_stream,
            write_stream,
            InitializationOptions(
                server_name="example",
                server_version="0.1.0",
                capabilities=server.get_capabilities(
                    notification_options=NotificationOptions(),
                    experimental_capabilities={},
                ),
            ),
        )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio

    asyncio.run(run())
```

### Writing MCP Clients

The SDK provides a high-level client interface for connecting to MCP servers:

```python
from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters, types
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client

# Create server parameters for stdio connection
server_params = StdioServerParameters(
    command="python",  # Executable
    args=["example_server.py"],  # Optional command line arguments
    env=None,  # Optional environment variables
)


# Optional: create a sampling callback
async def handle_sampling_message(
    message: types.CreateMessageRequestParams,
) -> types.CreateMessageResult:
    return types.CreateMessageResult(
        role="assistant",
        content=types.TextContent(
            type="text",
            text="Hello, world! from model",
        ),
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        stopReason="endTurn",
    )


async def run():
    async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(
            read, write, sampling_callback=handle_sampling_message
        ) as session:
            # Initialize the connection
            await session.initialize()

            # List available prompts
            prompts = await session.list_prompts()

            # Get a prompt
            prompt = await session.get_prompt(
                "example-prompt", arguments={"arg1": "value"}
            )

            # List available resources
            resources = await session.list_resources()

            # List available tools
            tools = await session.list_tools()

            # Read a resource
            content, mime_type = await session.read_resource("file://some/path")

            # Call a tool
            result = await session.call_tool("tool-name", arguments={"arg1": "value"})


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio

    asyncio.run(run())
```

### MCP Primitives

The MCP protocol defines three core primitives that servers can implement:

| Primitive | Control               | Description                                         | Example Use                  |
|-----------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Prompts   | User-controlled       | Interactive templates invoked by user choice        | Slash commands, menu options |
| Resources | Application-controlled| Contextual data managed by the client application   | File contents, API responses |
| Tools     | Model-controlled      | Functions exposed to the LLM to take actions        | API calls, data updates      |

### Server Capabilities

MCP servers declare capabilities during initialization:

| Capability  | Feature Flag                 | Description                        |
|-------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `prompts`   | `listChanged`                | Prompt template management         |
| `resources` | `subscribe`<br/>`listChanged`| Resource exposure and updates      |
| `tools`     | `listChanged`                | Tool discovery and execution       |
| `logging`   | -                            | Server logging configuration       |
| `completion`| -                            | Argument completion suggestions    |
